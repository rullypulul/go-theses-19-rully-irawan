The Virtue of tolerance
Is through the exercise of tolerance
That I discover the possibility
Of doing things and learning different things with different people
Being tolerant is not a question of being naïve
On the contrary it is a duty to be tolerant
An ethical duty, a historical duty, a political duty
But it does not demand that I lose my personality

As said by Paulo Freire on his last public interview for literacy.org in 1996 (LiteracyDotOrg & YouTube, 2009) 

The subject of my research is the invisible sets of structure that are overlooked inside the environment of art education in the Netherlands. How these hidden sets of rules are actually the major factor that is determining the development process inside the journey of finding “originality” for students as myself within the graphic design education. Through this project, I am investigating invisible or hidden sets of standards among students at art schools in the Netherlands and in graphic design education in general. I want to take it to the surface and furthermore, I am comparing this research to my own experiences as a student at KABK. In my project I am looking for relevant empirical data (i.e. articles, papers, etc.) generate my own data in collaboration with relevant participants and make a narrative story based on my own experiences.  My overall research question in this project is concerned with how hidden sets of standards/ curriculum among students might affect the individuals creative process and possible lead to similarities or trend that will affect the individuals own identity in terms of graphic design. My goal is trying to pull these invisibles to the surface, put it on the table so we can realize and analyse them to reflect on them, make use of them or maybe even modify them for the better.

Coming to the Netherlands in 2014 was one of my biggest decisions in life. I departed from my home country to expand my knowledge and skills in Graphic design. I left my usual life to a whole new one. At that moment I was already working full-time as a freelance graphic designer for several years with the knowledge that I learned through free tutorials, intuition, and experiences. I didn’t have any formal education in the subject. My last education was at high school and I tried two years of fine art at a university in Indonesia that I didn’t finish. So it has been a while for me to be inside an education system.  
 
The only thought I had back in 2014 when I moved was that it was going to be very different both in regards to the school system and to the culture. I expected that the system would be better than Indonesia. The Netherlands is a developed country after all. According to data from UNESCO, the Netherlands is number 6 in educations comparing to Indonesia
 
Looking at the mission statement in KABK’s study guide as an example, 
 
“The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (KABK) educates students to become independent and self-aware artists and designers with investigative mindsets and unique visual and conceptual abilities. They are able to produce authentic and in-depth creative work that advances their chosen disciplines and contributes to the wellbeing of society as a whole.” (KABK 2017)
 
Also stated in the study guide that the final qualification is defined in terms competencies. We as students are going to be assessed based on these competencies. 
 
“The following competencies are addressed in the programmes:
• Creative ability (Creërend vermogen)
• Capacity for critical reflection (Vermogen tot kritische reflectie)
• Capacity for growth and innovation (Vermogen tot groei en vernieuwing)
• Organisational ability (Organiserend vermogen)
• Communicative ability (Communicatief vermogen)
• External awareness (Omgevingsgerichtheid)
• Capacity for collaboration (Vermogen tot samenwerken)” (KABK 2018)
 
In reality aside from these written structures, in the course of my study period until now in my 4th year, I have encountered several invisible structures that are actually determining characteristics of art education in the Netherlands.

Looking at the mission statement of  KABK to make their students be able to work autonomously. Students are being encouraged to be critical and to have the capability to grow and innovate. This capability will of course gradually be taught in the course of the study period. Usually, in the earlier years of bachelor degree we are often faced with situations that are challenging our individuality and unknowingly we are succumbed to the pressure of a social group and might end up following the stream. This natural reaction usually happens as a reaction to the desire of a human being as a social person to fit in and be accepted by others. From the Asch social experiment in 1951, it has been shown how a person can lose their individuality because of the influence of the social majority. Solomon Asch conducted a social experiment involving 50 male test subjects from Swarthmore College in the USA.  In every session, he gathered 7 male in a room sitting side by side. Only one of the persons in the row is really a test subject, the other 6 are a helper of the experimenter. The test subject doesn’t know that the other 6 are actually not a real test subject. The experiment scenario was, the experimenter showed sheets of white paper with lines printed on it.
 
The left line has a pair that is exactly the same length with one of the lines on the right. There are 3 lines with numbers underneath each of them so the test subject can just say which number of lines are the same as the left one. The test subjects are strategically placed second to the last to answer the test. So the helpers are giving their answers first which later might affect the answer to the real test subject. Each person has to say their answer publicly after they are shown the sheet of paper. 
 
In a course of 18 tests in total, the fake test subjects gave 12 wrong answers, which are placed strategically along the course of the test so the test subject won’t be suspicious. With this experiment, Solomon Asch was looking if the real test subject would conform and follow the answers from the majority, which are the fake test subjects. After the test, he measured how many times the test subjects fall under the peer pressure of the fake participant's answers. About 32% of the test subject conformed to the majority answers although the answers were totally wrong. In the 12 wrong answers about 75% of test subject conforms at least one time and the other 25% never conforms. In the group that there was no pressure to conform to the fake test subjects, it was less than 1% of the test subjects gave the wrong answers. 
 
This conformity experiment was a reaction to Sheriff’s conformity experiment in 1935, which Asch believed that there’s no correct answer to the equivocal answers. There can be no assurance because there were no correct answers in the test.
 
After the test, the test subjects got interviewed and some of them said although when the answer was against their beliefs they still had chosen the wrong ones to agree with the larger part so they avoid peculiarity and feeling humiliation. Some of them actually believed that the answer from the mass was correct. According to Asch, there are two reasons for people to conform. One is the desire to fit in with he group and/or that they believed that the majority have more knowledge about the matter than them.  (McLeod 2008)
 
If we take this conclusion and compare it to situations of new students inside a full classroom full of different people with different cultural background there is a big possibility that this element is present to each of the individuals in the classroom. There will be some benefit off course if the individual already used to these type of situation because of cultural advantages.

| 0:00:24  | which of the three lines and the right is able to      |

On the other hand, being different and unique is an attitude that is endorsed in the environment on art education. Everybody has this tendency to avoid clichés. Concepts or visual style that are overused are going to be avoided. Of course, there are many factors that shaped this attitude. It is not written on paper somewhere, but it is present in the norm and social behavior of the school. The teachers and other students will give you more recognition and appreciation if you have an interesting concept. Somehow that is a reward that can make an individual who is seeking approval on personal ideas feel secure about what they are doing. So everyone is finding their own way of expressing themselves in an enclosure that is tamed by the presence of grades and teachers taste and opinions.
 
Emphasizing on this matter, Jonathan Touboul, a mathematician in the United States has proved that the effort of trying to be different communally will end up with the same result. The hipster movement and the anti-conformist attitude inspired him. He stated that trying hard to be different often ends up being alike. This is caused by the delay that is necessary for an information to be communicated. This delay causes a latency by the hipsters in detecting trends. Which will result that they make the same decision and thus mutually connected with each other.  (Touboul 2014)
 
These two contrasting attitudes are constantly being presented in our thought process as students. The dilemma between these two will be less felt along the years as subconsciously we kind of figured out our identity. But at the same time, we are being shaped by the early challenges in our education period.

Getting exposures and recognition is one of the things that can impact your work as a graphic designer/artist. Whereas a graphic designer, you are constantly collaborating with others so it is necessary that you have connections that might be useful for a sustainable career path in the future. Having the interconnecting realm of the World Wide Web demands graphic designers to be aware and updated with what is happening through the web. To have the freedom and knowledge on how to make use of social media platform to showcase your work is an unwritten necessity.
 
For example, there are many Instagram accounts that are curating graphic design work from graphic designers around the world and sharing them in their accounts and these accounts usually have many followers that will automatically be a viewer and gave the possibility of recognition and respect from the outside world to the graphic designer and hopefully generate clients and opportunities. The thing is these curated Instagram accounts have their own standards that made all the works in one Instagram account look similar. These standards that the Instagram accounts entails can influence the trend that is being followed by graphic design students.
 
Michael Bierut, a graphic designer, design critic, and design educator, states in an interview that the Internet has changed the way we do design work: 
 
“Internet has changed the way we do design work you had the option to sort of drown yourself in influence. Back in the day you could just sort of go into your room and come up with stuff and everything seemed original because you only had access to the tiniest sliver of what the world would have done up to that point. Now you have a window onto that world which is both illuminating and blinding in a way right? People used to have some confidence that he can roll out something over time and maybe after a year or two it would sort of start to catch on and kind of be a nice slow build for it. Now people just want to introduce it with a YouTube video and unless the feedback is you know tons of likes and lots of enthusiasm by noon the next day people start to worry that ‘uh oh we did the wrong thing’. One tweet can be retweeted enough times to bring everything down and so a company who’s introducing something new they all of a sudden can put their finger in the air and see whether the wind is blowing in their direction or against them, and it’s very unnerving because people’s first reaction of things isn’t necessarily reliable and kind of remind yourselves your original goal was, and figure out how this reaction plays in or whatever that goal was.” (Bierut 2014)

A characteristic of a society is not only something that is written on paper like a code of conduct or a law on paper. These written rules are guidance on what to do, but if we experience it and look deeper on the process, there are many unwritten things that are happening that is actually a major part for the essence on the identity of the society itself. This relationship between the written and the unwritten somehow defines the form of the behavior of the society. 

Inside an educational society these planning and structure are laid out and written in a curriculum that will be applied by teachers to the students as learning content.

Curriculum is the term for the lesson that is being intentionally taught in school, specific course or an academic program. Dictionaries definition of curriculum that stated it as the course that is offered by a school is rarely used in its general sense. It depends on how broad the educators looks at the term, commonly it refers to the education and skills students are expected to absorb and understand, Including the standard learning objectives the are expected to meet such as lessons, assignments, and projects that are given by the educators including all sorts of mediums and platforms that are for the purpose of learning.
(Great Schools Partnership, 2014)

As explained by Shao-Wen Su in her essay “The Various Concepts of Curriculum and the Factors Involved in Curricula-making” Curriculum is many things. It is because to conclude what is a curriculum it is really complex. It is an object, a planning, a structure, an experience, a menu that will be applied to the learners under the education institution. The term itself are pointing to the content of academic lesson. (Su, 2012)

Hidden Curriculum

According to the professor assistant Merfat Ayesh Alsubaie (2015), many hidden curricular issues are a result of social constructed assumptions and expectations that are not formally established and communicated within the learning environment. As a consequence to this, Alsubaie argues that the awareness of curricular issues becomes a consideration, which can lead to both negative and positive influences in the learning environment and thereby also the individuals belief system. The concept of a hidden curriculum refers to the aforementioned unspoken/unwritten, such as norms, behaviors and implicit values that exist in social setting, the educational setting, however something that is not visible.
(Alsubaie, 2015) 

Freire who wrote critical pedagogy wrote about a term that is called “Hidden Curriculum” that explain these side effect, the unwritten rules that came along with the written rules. This is not necessarily a negative thing. These side effects are not intentional and not official.

In order to investigate my overall subject for my thesis, I chose to conduct an interview with both students and teachers through questionnaires, which can be found in the end of the thesis as Appendix – Interview. 
 
In my questionaries’ for the students, I intentionally asked the respondents about their personal experience of hidden standards, because I want to see opinions from other individuals and whether they are sharing the same experience as me. Based on the student’s answers question 6 is important, because all respondents agree that they have to fit into certain social standards within their school. Although, I already expected these answers, it is clear to my investigation that the students share the same experiences of certain standards, however they experience it differently. 
Student 1 says he/she feels that some teachers are very subjective, however student 1 also answers that he/she designs specifically to please teachers in order to pass the year. Furthermore, student 3 says that if students do not listen and thereby design after the school’s intended agenda, things will get way harder, and students are less supported in their work. These answers emphasize that the students' motivation for designing is affected by the subjectivity of the teachers whether it is intentionally or not. Unlike the other students, student 4 is already conscious about this matter. Student 4 expresses that he/she already knows this matter as he/she says: “… this is clear from the very beginning that we accept on buying the education that this institution offers. We are immediately under the position of proving the institution we are fit enough for their education. Then we become almost like products of this education we have to prove to the teachers and the public that we are the embodiment of the curricula.”  With these comments in mind it is noticeable to look at students 2’s answers, as he/she shows regret for being conformed in different ways, because of insecurity of own work and thereby got too affected in the process of finding originality within his/her work. 
 
To create a more diverse and inclusive investigation of invisible standards in art education, I decided to send a questionnaire to teachers from graphic design schools as well. Throughout my questions I aimed to discover the teachers' personal experiences as practitioners and if their personal taste and sensibilities might affect their judgments on the students. In the answers I discovered that all the teachers do not intentionally try to affect the students' way of designing, as teacher 2 states: “It doesn’t, or at least I try not to use my own preferences for things as judgment; that is not what I consider education/studying/learning. ” However teacher 1 states that it is difficult, because his/her students are curious about the teachers own work: “That’s of course difficult, because my students are curious and always  ask to see more of my own projects or designs that I personally appreciate (things I like or find interesting), but then as a teacher I need to take care, it’s not one given style, aesthetics or path of thinking. It must be wide-open to broaden their scope, so each student can grab what is there for them. That’s why I rather send them to read an interesting article or go to exhibitions to keep their own unique way of seeing the world.” In the same answer, the teacher also explain that the assessment of students is more based on their progress rather than the outcome of the assignment they do. Especially in the earlier years of education. This specific answer raises awareness of how abstract the assessment on creative process and how it really depends on personal communication between teacher and students. It is therefore important for everyone involved in the education environment to not only be aware of this but also actively try to minimize the effect, which is also emphasized by teacher 3 who states the following: “I try to be fair and as much impartial as I can when guiding a student but I am absolutely aware of my own biases, tastes and preferences and how that influences my guidance. This is why the process is for me so crucial, more than final results I give feedback and assess the process, progress, engagement. This does not mean the final result are not very important as well but it is not the one and only thing that matters in my class. I have given very positive feedback to students which final formal expression I don’t particularly like, but I know it is good, it is not for me to judge formal preferences. That does not mean I can not see the difference from something I know is good, intriguing and distinct to something bad and boring or obvious.” 
 
 
The purpose of this thesis is to put a light on these invisible sets of standards that are present and often overlooked. I want to pull it to the surface and make it explicit to the viewers in the hope that the viewers can make use of the information to embrace these standards and make use of it. I say embrace, because these invisible sets of standards will always be present inside a structure of a society, because in a society or groups of social relations (I.e. classroom, school halls, outside school) there will always be different hidden values made be the same people inside the group and it is better to accept it the best possible way. What is interesting for my thesis’ conclusion, is that I found that the way these social values or invisible sets of standards are created as social norms inside a group, in the first place, is because the people within the group are being affected by different factors:
 
According to Solomon Asch’s social experiment there are two main reasons for a person to conform. One is because of the person’s fear of being ridiculed or humiliated in front of the rest of the group and two is because the person feels that the masses are better informed than them. Both of these reasons are relating with personal confidence, which aligns with some of the answers from the students I interviewed. The majority of the students I interviewed answered that their motivation for designing is affected by the subjectivity of the teachers in their school. One student explicitly wrote that one of the ways to pass the year is conforming to what the teacher wants. On the other hand it is also a tricky situation if you want to be unique and going on a different path than the majority and the invisible standards within the social group.  As a counter to this, Jonathan Touboul states that trying to be different than the majority often will leads to the same choices because of the delay in how information travels. This delay is causing the anti-conformist taking a mutually connected decision. 
 
Aside from internal social relations in art education we also have to consider the impact from the outside environment that has been amplified by the overwhelming amount of information from the Internet. Michael Bierut points out that we should not forget what was our initial purpose of the design we made and be critical to which information we absorb if it is going to enrich our purpose or in fact destroy it.
 
My thesis is not about pointing fingers at anyone, but simply research that can give insights to personal experiences of invisible sets of standards and how it affects the social environment in art education. Through my investigation, I found that invisible sets of standards in art education are inevitable as long as there is a group of social relations. I believe if this mindset are encouraged, embraced and celebrated inside the culture of the school, it would benefit to the process of finding our individuality. By embracing these, we can start trusting the intention of these invisible entities that actually shape the core identity of the society in art school. We can filter and choose which one is beneficial and which one we should change. We shouldn’t be worried about the relationship between individuals in the education society whether its among students or between students and teachers. We should together worry more about whether or not we are putting enough effort to find originality within ourselves and our position in graphic design. 
 
I want to say thank you to Karen and Phil Rynearson for introducing me to the following poem that inspired me the spirit to write this thesis: 
 
The child is made of one hundred – a poem by Loris Malaguzzi
 
The child is made of one hundred.
The child has a hundred languages
a hundred hands
a hundred thoughts
a hundred ways of thinking
of playing, of speaking.
A hundred, always a hundred
ways of listening
of marveling
of loving
a hundred joys for singing
and understanding
a hundred worlds to discover
a hundred worlds to invent
a hundred worlds to dream.
The child has a hundred languages
(and a hundred hundred hundred more)
but they steal ninety-nine
the school and the culture
separate the head from the body.
They tell the child to think
without hands
to do without head
to listen and not speak
to understand without joy
to love and marvel
only at Easter and Christmas.
They tell the child
to discover the world already there
and of the hundred
they steal ninety-nine.
They tell the child that
work and play
reality and fantasy
science and imagination
sky and earth
reason and dream
are things
that do not belong together.
And thus they tell the child
that the hundred is not there.
The child says:
No way. The hundred is there!
 (Rowe 2010)

These hidden standards are really abstract and there are many factors that make them different from one school to another. Through this method I was trying to bring it to the table and try to construct a conclusion that is showing the invisible characteristics in the curriculum of art education in Netherlands.

| 5. | I think I ‘scanned’ through it once in the first year. I think   |

+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | Not with students. But with some teachers, I think.              |
|    | I have the feeling that at school some teachers are very         |
|    | subjective. And of course, you want to pass the year,            |
|    | so then sometimes you just make something you know that          |
|    | the teacher likes or is a bit similar to their ’style’.          |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | Uhm I don’t know. I think it’s nice to have teacher from         |
|    | ‘outside’ because they’re still in the bubble. But sometimes     |
|    | I also miss the teacher teacher that you have had at Highschool, |
|    | who is trained to teach.                                         |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. | Yeah think so, but goes for everyone I guess.                    |
|    | You get so many references that you might like and               |
|    | that you will maybe adapt to your own designs etc.               |

|    | is close to what the student is explaining or trying to say.     |
|    | This is relevant because I expect from a teacher to assist       |
|    | me in my process, regardless if the subject is interesting       |
|    | to him/herself. A teachers function is to help me define         |
|    | my goals and my visions and showing me of thinking               |
|    | (different approaches).                                          |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. | One of the most inspiring teachers that I had in                 |
|    | my preparation course back home did an exchange at               |
|    | Rietveld and knowing that I was thinking to move abroad          |
|    | suggested me the school. Netherlands is also quite renown        |
|    | for having many international students, a general                |
|    | open-mindedness and to be design oriented.                       |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. | I wanted a more playful approach on things than back home.       |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. | I am really not familiar with the other departments,             |
|    | but graphic design kabk critical design plays an important role. |
|    | I was aware of this when I applied and as others that was        |
|    | one aspect that draw me to the school, on the other hand         |
|    | I tend to be reluctant towards it if                             |
|    | the topic seems imposed on me.                                   |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | I knew really little about graphic design and it's protagonist   |
|    | before starting Kabk, this made me really insicure about my work |
|    | in the beginning, now i regret that my view got conformed        |
|    | on so many aspects.                                              |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | This question is tricky. I think it is rhetoric and that you     |
|    | knowor expect a certain answer. Every teacher that I had         |
|    | influenced me in a way or another and I takes many "shapes",     |
|    | there could be a teacher with a very eccentric practice that     |
|    | does not speak to my taste at all, but it would still show me    |
|    | the immense richnessor possibilities on how to do things,        |
|    | and personally that is influence i like the most: I am not       |
|    | pressured to reach the same level of this person because         |
|    | our interest are so different, but this is what is freeing       |
|    | me in my choices. Then there could be a teacher that really      |
|    | impresses me, when you think "I wish I did this thing",          |
|    | here I always enter in conflict of wanting to do something       |
|    | as good, but my ego is not allowing me to copy, I want it        |
|    | to just come from my head, that would make me prouder of         |
|    | myself I guess. And of course in the back of your mind you       |
|    | always explore how you can please a teacher, but I never         |
|    | feels good to go that way, it means you did not work good enough |
|    | on it to come up with something that surprises you. But so much  |
|    | also depends on the link you have to a teacher,the "personal     |
|    | relation", I feel that than more a teacher invest in me          |
|    | than more i feel investing myself obviously.                     |

| 8. | No answer                                                        |

|                               Student 3                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. | 2 years                                                          |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. | Someone who helps you further in finding and improving           |
|    | yourself, non-authoritarian, someone who finds positive          |
|    | in everything, someone who stimulates and passes over            |
|    | his/her own passion for the work. Furthermore someone            |
|    | who takes his position as a leader to push you, help you,        |
|    | someone you look up to but besides that can be talked to         |
|    | as a friend/ as someone on the same level of the hierarchy.      |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. | It was more of a coincidence, I would have never chosen for      |
|    | it if my previous teachers in Antwerp didn’t recommend this      |
|    | school for an internship.                                        |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. | Good question, finding my own part in the world of design/art    |
|    | and learn the practical knowledge to achieve this                |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. | No                                                               |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | Yes, I think the KABK really has a certain style, a certain      |
|    | vision.if you don’t listen to this agenda things are getting     |
|    | way harder, you are less supported and less encouraged.          |
|    | Niels as perfect example, Matthias and Kevin as the antidote.    |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | For sure, I think it’s a good thing to have people who are not   |
|    | teaching something in a world of which they themselves are a     |
|    | stranger. I had teachers in Antwerp who were teachers but not    |
|    | in the professional practice anymore for                         |
|    | few years, this was HORRIBLE :)                                  |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. | No doubt bout that, the previous four years I have been working  |
|    | to much towards their position, I’m still “fighting”             |
|    | against this on a daily base.                                    |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                Student 4                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. | 5 long years                                                     |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. | One that triggers your curiosity and opens up doors that         |
|    | you weren’t aware of.                                            |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. | I honestly did not have in mind coming to the Netherlands        |
|    | to study art, I only knew I wanted to come to The art academy    |
|    | in The Hague one month before doing my entrance exam.            |
|    | I did not search for any tother school in the Netherlands,       |
|    | in fact I didn’t even look for KABK, it was a friend told me     |
|    | about it who convinced me to apply there. I still do not know    |
|    | how he got to know the school because he is not really into      |
|    | art at all. It was a mix of opportunity and chance.              |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. | I thought KABK was a radical school of art where artworks        |
|    | were occupying hallways and people had the freedom to be         |
|    | radical with their work, and do it big. Or thats what a friend   |
|    | of my uncle told me, he is a fine arts teacher in Brussels       |
|    | but he went there once to visit and told me it looked crazy      |
|    | and radical. He told me it would be really hard for me to        |
|    | get in since I never did any education in art.                   |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. | The churchly for graphic design sounds like they are offering    |
|    | you a great deal, they use buzzwords such as critical thinkers,  |
|    | versatile practitioners, social engagement… It is all a marketing|
|    | campaign after all and we are the ones that fell for it.         |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | Yes, but this is clear from the very beginning that we accept    |
|    | on buying the education that this institution offers. We are     |
|    | immediately under the position of proving the institution we     |
|    | are fit enough for their education. Then we become almost like   |
|    | products of this education we have to prove to the teachers and  |
|    | the public that we are the embodiment of the curricula.          |
|    | Being able to even access and having the opportunity to enter    |
|    | a space like a prestigious art academy soon became a privilege   |
|    | I did not feel worthy of. Access in a big part of your feeling   |
|    | of belonging to a space, many selections were made from who was  |
|    | allowed and who was not allowed to enter KABK based on their     |
|    | ability to be a good graphic designer. Only the good applicants  |
|    | can enter and enjoy the opportunity of such a space, only if     |
|    | you have proved your are good enough,                            |
|    | while the bad applicants are denied.                             |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | Yeah I think this is a great thing because you get to have       |
|    | access to the actual design practices of these teachers and      |
|    | you get to learn what kind of relationship they have with        |
|    | their work. This I think is something that you can               |
|    | learn many things from.                                          |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. | Not at all, what I feel is that the school/institution is        |
|    | interested in producing certain kind of students and this        |
|    | obviously makes an effect in the work you produce.               |
|    | However I do not think is the teachers fault since they          |
|    | are as well victims of this educational system.                  |

Teachers Questionnaire:

+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. | How long have you been teaching?                                 |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. | What do you think is a "good student”?                           |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. | Do you have a guideline on what to teach to students?            |
|    | How strict is this guideline to be followed?                     |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. | Do you have much freedom to plan your own curriculum?            |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. | At the school where you teach, it has many international         |
|    | students, how do you deal with multicultural individuals         |
|    | in one class?                                                    |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | With your experience as a graphic designer, you developed        |
|    | personal taste and sensibilities on graphic design, how big      |
|    | does it affect your judgment on students that are on             |
|    | the process of shaping their own taste and sensibilities?        |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | What do you think is the characteristics of art education        |
|    | in the Netherlands?                                              |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. | Do you think this culture inside the school is a                 |
|    | micro-reflection on graphic design community                     |
|    | in the Netherlands?                                              |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                             Teacher 1                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. | Two years at Design Academy Eindhoven. But I do many             |
|    | workshops and guest lectures across the globe for                |
|    | quite some years.                                                |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. | Open to learn, curious, the one who is driven or                 |
|    | passionate about discovering new potentials.                     |
|    | Student who is not afraid to experiment and play                 |
|    | and fully incorporate that "freshness" or even a                 |
|    | "failure" into her/his projects. The one who wishes              |
|    | to think more, goes deeper and investigates the matter           |
|    | she/he is currently focused on. The one who,enjoys               |
|    | the discipline she/he is studying (design for example).          |
|    | And of course the critical one, or even                          |
|    | better a self-critical.                                          |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. | Yes I have, but we've made it ourselves, as teachers.            |
|    | I teach together with amazing theoretician Ilga Minjon           |
|    | class called Society and Change. In order to be a good           |
|    | teacher I need to set some goals of the class and then           |
|    | follow different activities to get there. Then I need            |
|    | to critically look back on what worked and what was a            |
|    | struggle to make it better next time. This guideline             |
|    | is strict for me to follow and if assignments have               |
|    | certain criteria, then it's also strict for students.            |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. | Yes. ;-) You mean cur. of my students, right? I do,              |
|    | but it also needs to fill in the gap of other classes            |
|    | in the year (so it's unique and students learn different         |
|    | skills) and it also follows higher vision of the academy.        |
|    | So my class is inside this bigger context.                       |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. | I see no individuals; the class is one big exciting mesh         |
|    | of different backgrounds, life stories and little universes.     |
|    | It's totally multi-cultural and that's what enriches all         |
|    | the students, to learn from others and see their different       |
|    | contexts. It's a 70% non-Dutch class                             |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | That's of course difficult, because my students are curious      |
|    | and always,ask to see more of my own projects or designs         |
|    | that I personally appreciate (things I like or find              |
|    | interesting), but then as a teacher I need to take care,         |
|    | it's not one given style, aesthetics or path of thinking.        |
|    | It must be wide-open to broaden their scope, so each student     |
|    | can grab what is there for them. That's why I rather send        |
|    | them to read an interesting article or go to                     |
|    | exhibition – to keep their own unique way of seeing              |
|    | the world. Judging students it's always more about their         |
|    | progress within the class, the process of developing             |
|    | the design project and attitude than just the outcome.           |
|    | That counts especially for my 1st years now. You have time       |
|    | to focus on the outcome in 3rd and 4th year much more then.      |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | That's a big question I don't have time to answer,               |
|    | but what truly got me is here, we are focused on looking         |
|    | into the future. Being responsible towards that, while           |
|    | knowing our context. And that's one of many aspects of           |
|    | NL design education that I really appreciate.                    |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. | I don't know (which culture > "this culture"?).                  |
|    | School is school, GD community is GD community.                  |

| 1. | 10 years                                                         |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. | I don’t really understand what this question has to              |
|    | do with the idea of “hidden curriculum”? its also not            |
|    | really a question i think is particularly interesting            |
|    | to answer. i.e. what is good design?                             |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. | What is a guideline? I guess I don’t?                            |
|    | Can you be more clear?                                           |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. | Yes, full freedom, as do all the teachers in our department.     |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. | can you be more specific? What do mean by 'deal with'? I’m       |
|    | very appreciative of the international/multicultural mix at      |
|    | school, it makes for a more layered and nuanced studying.        |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | It doesn’t, or at least i try not to use my own preferences      |
|    | for things as judgement; that is not what i consider             |
|    | education/studying/learning.                                     |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | Conceptual approach, connected to legacies/structures of         |
|    | modernist design and art education; at least                     |
|    | this is at the Rietveld.                                         |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. | I don’t understand this question...                              |

|                               Teacher 3                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. | I have been teaching since 2012.                                 |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. | A curious and engaged student. But we would have define “good”   |
|    | first for me to give an accurate answer.                         |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. | I do have a guideline and maybe it is important to know on what  |
|    | this guideline is based.,It is based on my experience as         |
|    | a design student and also as a designer. It is made in context   |
|    | of the level I teach and it is also based on my perspective on   |
|    | design and education at large. My guideline is a structure or    |
|    | a skeleton to be filled in by the students. This means it is     |
|    | strict and very flexible at the same time, each student can      |
|    | customise it.,I believe in the concept of elastic pedagogy       |
|    | (I coined the term in an essay in 2018), it means the constant   |
|    | dance, action-reaction, back and forward, of the pedagogic       |
|    | process. I am constantly reacting to each and all students,      |
|    | adapting and adjusting to the course of my lessons.              |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. | Yes I am given total freedom. I do need to take in               |
|    | consideration the whole curriculum and                           |
|    | my colleagues programme too.                                     |

| 5. | I am not aware that I directly deal or address the topic         |
|    | per se (with the exception of the project I made within          |
|    | the context of why master programme and that will be continued)  |
|    | but I think it is a privilege to both me and the students        |
|    | to learn in an environment so diverse. In the context            |
|    | of graphic design is extremely interesting because such          |
|    | context demonstrates all the different histories and voices      |
|    | of the world and it is half way to such acknowledgement and      |
|    | inclusion in the design process. For me personally it is an      |
|    | aspect I would like to address more consciously                  |
|    | and with more effect                                             |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | I try to be fair and as much impartial as I can when guiding     |
|    | a student but I am absolutely aware of my own biases, tastes     |
|    | and preferences and how that influences my guidance. This is     |
|    | why process is for me so crucial, more than final results        |
|    | I give feedback and assess process, progress, engagement.        |
|    | This does not mean the final result are not very important       |
|    | as well but it is not the one and only thing that matters        |
|    | in my class. I have given very positive feedback to students     |
|    | which final formal expression I don’t particularly like,         |
|    | but I know it is good, it is not for me to judge formal          |
|    | preferences. That does not mean I can not see the difference     |
|    | from something I know is good, intriguing and distinct           |
|    | to something bad and boring or obvious.                          |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | I think there is a long tradition of art and design education    |
|    | in the Netherlands and that reflects in the quality of such      |
|    | education, it is very good and very hands on. I find it quite    |
|    | interesting that professionals and not just academics are        |
|    | the majority of the faculty in most academies. The problem       |
|    | with that is that there is not much high level theory and        |
|    | reflection and positioning or criticism within the academies.    |
|    | That is changing though and I see programmes getting more        |
|    | and more rigorous, including more and more theory in the         |
|    | curriculum without devaluing practice. There is another small    |
|    | problem with this last development, which is the high demands    |
|    | the courses are placing on students and faculty.,One last        |
|    | thing I would like to address is the crescent financial          |
|    | pressure put on education institutions. More and more schools    |
|    | are pressured to perform and deliver and so are faculty          |
|    | members and students. There is less space for failure,           |
|    | experiment, open processes. There is a very useful and           |
|    | interesting article from Pascal Gielen about                     |
|    | the Neo-liberalisation of art education that                     |
|    | might be interesting to you to read                              |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. | I need you to first specify 'this culture'                       |
|    | for me to answer your question.                                  |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+


+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                               Teacher 4                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. | I have been teaching since i was 27 (i am now 45, so near        |
|    | 20 years wohooo!). I started with giving workshops at Ecal       |
|    | in Lausanne. I have been teaching ever since, in all of          | 
|    | Europe and other parts of the world (like China and USA),        |
|    | but mostly in the Netherlands, at Rietveld Academie,             |
|    | HKU, Sint Joost Academie and now since 7 years                   |
|    | at the Royal Academy of Arts (KABK).                             |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. | Dedicated, concentrated, loyal to others and never afraid to     |
|    | experiment or fail. For the rest I refer and run my teaching     |
|    | practice largely to this wonderful document by John Cage and     |
|    | Sister Corita Kent: https://greg.org/archive/2014/03/25/sister-  |
|    | coritas-and-john-cages-rules.html that shows that education      |
|    | is a joint venture. Not just the student has responsibilities,   |
|    | but the teacher does so as well. It is a mutual co-existence     |
|    | after all.                                                       |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. | Not really. Per course we have a description that should         |
|    | loosely be followed. in general we have guidelines for           |
|    | the larger curriculum, which you can find online at              |
|    | the website of the academy                                       |
|    | https://www.kabk.nl/opleidingen/bachelor/grafisch-ontwerpen      |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. | Together with Niels (Schrader) I run the curriculum,             |
|    | so we decide together what we do and find important              |
|    | to address. The curriculum is run by the heads of department,    |
|    | the courses are run by the tutors - in which                     |
|    | they are allowed a lot of freedom.                               |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. | In our department we have more or less 32 nationalities,         |
|    | which make up around 50% of the student population.              |
|    | We try to let everybody(including our staff) to be aware of      |
|    | this fact and respect all the cultural subtleties and hope       |
|    | that everyone feels safe in our environment. If we feel or       |
|    | hear about anything that is not felt as ‘correct’ we try to      |
|    | address this immediately, often with our coordinator Ingrid      |
|    | Grunwald (who is herself from a mixed background) or our         |
|    | confidentiality person Pauline Schep.                            |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. | Of course I have ideas and senses about what is good and         |
|    | what is not good for my own practice, for myself and for         |
|    | my students. But i love to be surprised and expect               |
|    | my students to actually be ahead of everything I know            |
|    | and see! Which happens often but is never often enough :)))      |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. | Thats difficult to say for other academies – as i am only        |
|    | teaching and working in The Hague right now. I hope that         |
|    | we at Royal Academy in The Hague, we accumulate into             |
|    | a sort of new kaleidoscopic design attitude, that has            |
|    | a strong view on our world around us and designs a position      |
|    | rather that just form. I think and hope that with our            |
|    | tutors we are able to reflect and deliver this so called         |
|    | kaleidoscopic perspective for our students, from which           |
|    | they can develop their own independent position.                 |
|    | This independency is something I think is key to good            |
|    | art education: students at some point will not ‘need’            |
|    | the school anymore.                                              |
+----+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. | No. Although our tutors are amongst the best graphic             |
|    | designers, thinkers and artists in the Netherlands,              |
|    | a community as such is something that is more a myth than        | 
|    | a reality I think. Maybe it is easer for you to say as you       |
|    | were able to see this from outside of the ‘community’            |
|    | since you are not from here and are experiencing                 |
|    | this now as a student.                                           |

<p>The Hague, July 2018</p>
<p>1.2 Mission Statement</p>
<p>Mission and Vision</p>
<p>Mission<br>
The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (KABK) educates students to become independent and self-aware artists and designers with investigative mindsets,
distinctive visual and conceptual abilities, and the capacity to produce authentic and
in-depth creative work capable of playing a meaningful role in both their chosen disciplines and in society as a whole.</p>
<p>Vision<br>
The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague is founded on a vision of educational excellence leading to graduates that have the capacity to become leaders in their fields, who produce outstanding creative work and who dare to disturb. They are able<br>
to innovate, collaborate, and generate new knowledge. We teach students to probe how arts and design shape contemporary societies and contribute to cultural,<br>
economic, and social wellbeing within a global setting. We look outwards from the<br>
academy, interacting with the communities of The Hague, the Netherlands, and beyond, and aim to contribute to an inclusive debate on issues relevant to art, culture, and society.</p>
<p>The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague has been a leader in educating artists and designers since 1682, has an exceptional level of experience in higher education provision, and a long and rich history. Together with the Royal Conservatoire we form the University of the Arts and we cooperate closely with Leiden University. Our research-oriented community is made up of ten art and design departments whose small scale and intensive programmes offer access to the widest possible range of creative strategies, and who support and inspire each other. Some departments emphasise collaboration between specialists working in diverse teams, while others focus on developing interdisciplinary practice. Highly skilled professional staff, many with international professional practices, guide and accompany students through their studies. The teaching language is English. We offer Bachelor and Master degrees, and with Leiden University, a doctorate in art and design. These are supplemented by our preparatory courses and School for Young Talent.</p>
<p>In our culturally diverse academy, the commitment, passion, and curiosity of students and staff meet a respectful and tolerant learning environment that manifests the joy of learning, gives space for experiment and error, and understands meaning and making to be inseparable. We value skill and disciplinary expertise as well as interdisciplinary practice. We encourage innovation through collaboration and facilitate cri tical reflection on the ever- changing roles of artists and designers in our societies.</p>
<p>1.3 Organisation</p>
<p>Management</p>
<p>The director of the academy is Marieke Schoenmakers. She also is president of the<br>
Executive Board of the University of the Arts The Hague.</p>
<p>Deputy director education is Miriam Bestebreurtje.</p>
<p>Education<br>
The heads of the departments are responsible for the quality of the education. They ensure that the content of the programmes stay up to date and of the highest quality. They are also responsible for the quality of the teaching and for appointing the tutors.<br>
The heads are assisted by one or more coordinators, teachers and/or team leaders. Teaching staff may have special tasks, for example as coordinators for the propaedeutic year and internships.</p>

<p>1.4 Study information</p>
<p>1.4.1 Structure of the programmes</p>
<p>Bachelor’s programmes<br>
Propaedeutic and main phases<br>
The Bachelor’s programmes consist of a propaedeutic phase and a main phase.</p>
<p>The propaedeutic phase amounts to 60 ECs and consists of all the components in the first academic year. This propaedeutic phase has three functions:<br>
•   orientation: the student acquires a good understanding of the content of the programme and professional practice and the opportunities offered by this;<br>
•   selection: during this phase, both the student and the Academy assess whether the student is suitable for the programme;<br>
•   referral: on the basis of academic progress in the propaedeutic phase, the student is given a recommendation on the continuation of the programme.</p>
<p>At the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, students study their chosen discipline from the first year onwards (ArtScience, Fine Arts, Photography, Graphic Design, Interactive/Media/Design, Interior Design and Furniture Design or Textile and Fashion). The student becomes familiar with the many aspects of the discipline and professional practice, and is challenged to experiment a great deal and try things out. The programme also includes theoretical modules that are partly shared with<br>
students from other departments. A fixed component of the propaedeutic phase is the academy-wide propaedeutic project week.</p>
<p>Usually at the end of the first semester, but no later than the first week of the fourth block, all first-year bachelor students receive provisional interim recommendations concerning their study progress. At the end of the first year, students are given a binding study recommendation on the continuation of their studies. If their academic results are inadequate, this may be a negative binding study recommendation (see Article 15 of the Education and Examination Regulations on the provisions of a negative binding study recommendation).</p>
<p>The main phase amounts to 180 ECs and covers the second, third and fourth years of the programme. This phase focuses on the further deepening, positioning and professionalisation of the student within their own discipline. The artistic development of the student lies at the heart of the study programme. In addition, considerable attention is paid to theory and professional skills. The main phase concludes with the final examination. Once all study components have been completed successfully, the student is awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA).</p>
<p>Practice, theory and preparation for the profession<br>
Three main components can be distinguished in the education: practice, theory and preparation for the profession. These are offered in separate courses, but also<br>
elements of different components can be identified in most of the courses. Every department offers one or more courses that combine theoretical and practical teaching, meaning that the theory doesn’t remain ‘dry material’, but is linked directly</p>
<p>to artistic work. In other modules, artistic work is not only created, but also presented in a public setting, meaning that professional preparation and practice go hand in hand. In this way, our education foreshadows professional practice as far as<br>
possible.</p>
<p>The <h2 id="sequence">Individual</h2> Study Track (IST)<br>
The Individual Study Track (IST) forms part of the fulltime Bachelor’s programmes and the Master’s programme in ArtScience. Part-time students are also allowed space for the IST in their schedules, although this depends on whether the programme is mandatory for the department in question. In all fulltime Bachelor’s programmes, a total of 30 ECs is allocated for the IST. The distribution of these credits over the semesters is determined by each department. For the Master’s in ArtScience and part-time programmes, the number of ECs for the IST varies and is announced in the credit point overviews for each of the particular programmes.</p>
<p>The IST is an individual study programme that focuses on students’ own interests and preferences. It is important for students to discover their personal potential and ambition and to be able to tailor their studies accordingly. In addition, competence- based education requires students to learn to set their own learning objectives (e.g., for self-study). The IST plan offers an excellent opportunity for students to customise their studies.</p>
<p>The Individual Study Track includes the following opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The KABK’s Research Labs (see also: 1.4.4 Focus Issues &gt; Research)</li>
<li>The KABK’s Material Labs</li>
<li>Electives from Leiden University</li>
<li>Practicum Artium classes (painting, drawing, graphic design and photography)</li>
<li>Self-initiated projects</li>
<li>Projects from outside the KABK</li>
</ul>
<p>See 1.6.1 Procedures &gt; IST procedure for the procedures and regulations concerning the IST.</p>
<p>Master’s programmes<br>
One-year (Type and Media)<br>
The Master’s programme in Type and Media amounts to 60 ECs and has a duration<br>
of one year. In the first semester, the programme covers various techniques and skills (analogue and digital) including a revival assignment with a thesis on the origin<br>
and production of a historic typeface and a digital revival. In the second semester<br>
these skills are used to define, design and produce a new typeface. The Master programme is also involved in the organization of the triennial Gerrit Noordzij Award<br>
and the Robothon conference.</p>
<p>Two-year (all others)<br>
The Master’s programmes in Interior Architecture, ArtScience (MMus) and the Master programmes within the Master of Arts in Fine Art and Design - Artistic Research,<br>
Non-Linear Narrative, Industrial Design and Photography &amp; Society - all amount to<br>
120 ECs and have a duration of two years.</p>
<p>Due to their advanced nature, they differ quite in structure, catering as much as possible for individual research and project plans from students within the overall framework of the programme.</p>
<p>Language<br>
All education at the Royal Academy is initially in English, and communication is also in English. If it turns out that all of the students and teachers are Dutch-speaking,<br>
then the classes and the communication are held in Dutch.</p>
<p>1.4.2 Final qualifications, competencies and learning objectives</p>
<p>The final qualifications are defined in terms of competencies. These refer to coherent sets of knowledge, skills, attitudes and other personal qualities that enable students to perform professional tasks adequately and successfully, as well as to find and apply solutions in specific professional situations.</p>
<p>Students are considered competent or suitable for particular jobs or assignments when they are able to integrate the appropriate knowledge, skills and attitudes effectively in successful behaviour in specific situations. In other words, in addition to knowing how and why something should happen, students must also demonstrate their ability to make it happen.</p>
<p>Competence-based art education is characterised by an integral approach to knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is an educational form with a high degree of individual responsibility for the students, aimed at the students’ future careers. The emphasis on the personal development of the students and their talents results in flexible education with a variety of study opportunities, such as the choices that students can make in their personal individual study track. Within the programmes, the professional field is always represented by teachers who are active as artists or designers in addition to their teaching practice. Invitations are frequently extended to advisers and guest lecturers from various disciplines.</p>
<p>The following competencies are addressed in the programmes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative ability</li>
<li>Capacity for critical reflection, or at the master’s level: research ability</li>
<li>Capacity for growth and innovation</li>
<li>Organisational ability</li>
<li>Communicative ability</li>
<li>External awareness</li>
<li>Capacity for collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p>Creative ability, capacity for critical reflection/research ability and capacity for growth and innovation are the key competencies in art education. It is the creative ability that distinghuises the visual artist or designer from professionals in many other fields. External awareness is equally relevant, as it stresses the need to be able to put the artistic work in its historic and contemporary context.<br>
The capacity for critical reflection and external awareness are strongly interrelated, differing primarily in perspective (i.e., internal and external).</p>
<p>The remaining competencies, as indicated above, are organisational and communicative ability and capacity for collaboration. These abilities are developed more specifically in every department and in each year.</p>
<p>We specify the development of the competencies in terms of ‘learning objectives’: these specify what the student should know and be able to do at the end of each year. Learning objectives are formulated even more specifically at the level of the<br>
individual courses and projects. The learning objectives for each course can be found in the course descriptions.<br>
The competencies of visual communication/product/spatial designers and those of<br>
visual artists are described in their original form at a national level in the Educational Profiles for Fine Arts and Design1. The competencies for each academic year are specified in each department’s curriculum description.</p>
<p>1.4.3 Supervision and assessment</p>
<p>During their studies at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, students are assessed in a specific, extensive and very thorough manner. Because of the nature of artistic development and artistic work, the assessment methods used in art education differ from those used in other forms of higher education.<br>
Within the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, assessments are intended primarily to provide students with insight into the progress of their development as artists or designers, thus guiding them in making the appropriate choices for their further development. This focus on the individual development of students places special demands on the method of assessment. In addition to addressing the form of the work, assessments focus on the strength of the concept, the way in which the result has been achieved, the process and the student’s theoretical knowledge. This analysis of the students’ work and designs is carried out during the individual reviews and collective assessments.<br>
The collective assessments focus on the overall development of the student, combining the conclusions from the individual reviews and discussing the total body<br>
of the student’s work with the student. These discussions are led by (or on behalf of) the head of the department in order to clarify the specific issues at hand. Information on the various assessments, the composition of the different committees and their authoritative reach are specified in the Education and Examination Regulations (See Articles 18 through 21). It is particularly important for first-year students to read the<br>
rules on propaedeutic assessment and the binding recommendation on continuation of the study, which is issued at the end of the first year.</p>
<p>At the department of Fine Arts and in some cases also in other departments’ programmes, the individual reviews and collective assessments are combined in a single assessment.</p>
<p>Individual reviews<br>
In the individual reviews, students receive specific feedback and advice on the basis of their work and progress in each individual course from the respective teachers.</p>
<p>1 Overleg Beeldende Kunsten. Beroepsprofiel en opleidingsprofielen Beeldende Kunst en Vormgeving. Den Haag: Vereniging Hogescholen 2014.</p>
<p>Individual reviews aim to give students insight in their achievements to date and make recommendations for the next steps in their studies. The main focus is thus on discussing with students how they are developing artistically, professionally and personally, and on that basis, giving students useful guidance on how to get the most out of themselves. Individual reviews can either be given for all modules simultaneously during the assessments, or by individual teachers in each of the separate classes.<br>
Because of the development-oriented nature of the Individual reviews, these are not concluded with a final grade or result. Grades and results for individual subjects, if applicable, are determined in the collective assessments.</p>
<p>Collective assessments<br>
The collective assessment evaluates the integral development of the students, as well as their processes, products and skills. In addition to having an evaluative purpose, the assessment has the didactic objective of providing feedback to students on their attitudes, their work and the way in which they have approached the work or<br>
assignment, as well as the strength of the concept and their theoretical knowledge, taking their full body of work, the underlying creative and reflective processes and its presentation into account.</p>
<p>The collective assessment is based on the presentation of the student’s work, as well as on its development in comparison to previous assessments, also considering the feedback from the teachers of the various study components. Additional information<br>
is provided in the ‘Credit Allocation’ section (See 1.4.3 Supervision and assessment</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Study load and credits (EC))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each year, the competencies as described for that year in the specific discipline are taken into account during the collective assessments of the students and their work. Collective assessments are concluded with a grade, possibly combined with additional tasks for the student to complete before the start or during the next semester. Also, the final grades or results for individual courses, if applicable, are determined after the collective assessments in the light of their integral development.</p>
<p>Registration and archiving</p>
<ul>
<li>The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague has a system for registering the students’ results and progress, known as Osiris. All assessments, reviews and credits are registered and archived in this system.</li>
<li>Feedback texts by individual teachers are uploaded in Osiris after the individual reviews and subsequently made available to students.</li>
<li>The outcomes of the collective assessments are entered electronically in Osiris and<br>
archived using this system.</li>
<li>All collective assessments are authorised by the head of the department, on behalf of the assessment committee.</li>
<li>Each student has access to Osiris (see Student Portal for more information on how<br>
to access and use Osiris) and can check the results of the collective assessments and their credit overviews online. The deadline for the publication of results is 15 working days after the collective assessments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Study load and credits (EC)<br>
The study load is the number of hours a student typically needs within the framework of a specific study component in order to complete that component successfully. In addition to contact hours and classes, the measurement also includes hours of independent study, for example to read mandatory literature, to visit exhibitions or participate in excursions, for independent studio practice and for building up presentations of work for assessments.</p>
<p>Study load is expressed in terms of European Credits (ECs) in a system known as<br>
the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). One study year has a total of 1,680 hours. One EC is equal to a study load of 28 hours. One year of a<br>
fulltime programme thus amounts to 60 ECs (60 x 28 hours = 1,680 hours).</p>
<p>A Bachelor’s programme covers four years, each amounting to 60 ECs. The<br>
propaedeutic phase comprises 60 ECs, with the main phase covering the remaining<br>
180 ECs. Students must obtain a sufficient number of ECs each year in order to<br>
continue the programme, and they must receive all of the programme’s 240 ECs in order to complete the Bachelor’s degree.</p>
<p>The Master’s programme in Type and Media covers one year, amounting to 60 ECs. The other Master’s programmes cover two years, amounting to 120 ECs.</p>
<p>Credit allocation<br>
All study components in one semester have a combined study load of around 30<br>
EC’s. During the collective assessments, the assessment committee decides which components have been completed successfully (or not) and awards credits for each of these components, or for clusters of strongly related components, accordingly.<br>
This means that no grades are given or pass/fail decisions made during the individual reviews.</p>
<p>Please note that due to the different structure of the study programme in the ArtScience department (both Bachelor and Master), the allocation of credits takes place after the collective assessment that is linked to the final presentations made each semester.</p>
<p>Credit allocation for international exchanges<br>
Royal Academy of Art, The Hague students participating in foreign exchange programmes receive their credits according to the system used by the host<br>
institution. Many countries currently use the ECTS, and for those that do not, a way<br>
to convert the credits is formulated. Credits allocated by the host institution must be<br>
formally verified and registered by the assessment committee of the student’s<br>
department at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague. This is usually done during the collective assessment at the end of the semester in which the exchange has taken<br>
place.</p>
<p>International exchange students studying at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague fall under the protocol of the Academy.</p>
<p>Credit allocation for guest students<br>
Students from other institutions (e.g., Leiden University) who wish to take classes at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague require approval from their own institutions, as well as from the Academy. After a positive assessment, these students receive statements specifying the study load of the programme followed in ECs.</p>
<p>Credit allocation for internships<br>
Prior to the internship, each student draws up an internship plan. Evaluations form part of the internship, and each student is expected to make a presentation and/or write a report at the end of the internship. Credits are allocated once all conditions<br>
have been met. Please also refer to the department’s internship coordinator, who can<br>
provide more information on the internship process.</p>
<p>Credit allocation for individual study tracks<br>
Credits are reserved for the Individual Study Track (IST). The work carried out within the framework of the IST is not always addressed in the collective assessment (e.g.,<br>
electives at Leiden University or external projects). In such cases, the students are assessed by external parties, but the credits involved must be formally verified and registered by the assessment committee of the student’s department. This is usually done during the collective assessment at the end of the semester in which the IST activities have taken place.<br>
The department and the IST coach concerned can provide more information on the credit allocation process. As with all other credits, any credits earned through activities in the IST are not allocated until after the collective assessment.</p>
<p>Study and progress guidance<br>
The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague distinguishes between guiding students through the content of their programme and artistic development, and supervising<br>
their study progress. The guidance of the students’ artistic development takes place<br>
continuously, through ongoing discussions between students and teachers about their work and work processes. Students’ study progress is discussed with mentors and coaches. If students wish to talk confidentially, the Royal Academy of Art, The<br>
Hague has student counsellors (see 1.4.7 Organisational matters &gt; Confidential counselling).</p>
<p>Mentors<br>
Mentors guide students in the propaedeutic year and meet with students at least twice a year.<br>
The mentor is a teacher of the relevant discipline. The tasks of the mentor focus on<br>
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>discussing the student’s study progress;</li>
<li>discussing the assessment of the first semester;</li>
<li>discussing the assessment of the second semester;</li>
<li>keeping a concise record of the date and content of the conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case the student’s study progress is negatively affected by particular personal circumstances (illness, handicaps, family matters, financial issues, or any factor that</p>
<p>might cause delays in the study), the student is strongly recommended to discuss these with the mentor or the student counsellor as soon as possible (see 1.4.7<br>
Organisational matters &gt; Confidential counselling). These can then be considered and possibly taken into account when important decisions (e.g. on the binding study recommendation) are taken.</p>
<p>Coaches<br>
Coaches are available to students in the main phase. Several types of coach are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>General coach: this is often a teacher with a special role in a specific year of the department’s study programme. In some cases, the head of department assumes the role of coach. The tasks of the coach focus on discussing the student’s study progress and personal circumstances and keeping a concise<br>
record of the date and content of the conversations.</li>
<li>IST coach: this is a teacher of the relevant discipline who focuses on IST guidance. The IST coach approves the IST plans, assesses and evaluates the IST plan after completion and records ECs. See also part 1.6.1 Procedures &gt; IST procedure.</li>
<li>Internship coordinator: this is a teacher of the relevant discipline focused on the internship guidance. The internship coordinator is responsible for the process of the internship and subsequent evaluation. See also part 1.6.1<br>
Procedures &gt; Internship procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>1.4.4 Focus issues<br>
All study programmes at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague share a focus on three issues, that we consider to be fundamental to artistic practice and, therefore, to<br>
art education.</p>
<p>Research<br>
As the study programme progresses, students do an increasing amount of research. Research is intrinsic to the creation of art and three forms of research can be distinguished:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research on art</li>
<li>Research for and for the benefit of art and art practice, including research on<br>
social themes and art in relation to other disciplines</li>
<li>Research in and through the arts (artistic research)</li>
</ul>
<p>These three types of research form part of the departments’ curricula and the academic-wide education programme. Each department incorporates the four types of research in the curriculum in its own way and makes its own choices in relation to research.</p>
<p>Research &amp; Discourse<br>
Research and Discourse is a first-year bachelor’s course that links ‘making’ to<br>
‘thinking’ and puts students in contact with all departments within the academy. It forms part of the academic-wide education programme.</p>
<p>In the course of the first year, students consider different aspects of artistic practice and research. The practice of an artist or designer is all about making, but can there</p>
<p>be any making without thinking? This programme asks questions, discusses different visions, and invites students to become informed and reflect, both visually and mentally, on contemporary artistic discourse. They explore their role in the field of art and design and learn how to speak or write about this role.</p>
<p>The Research &amp; Discourse course consists of research seminars and lectures on discourse. It is a compulsory component of the first year of all bachelor’s programmes. Details on the course can be found at the website: <a href="http://www.kabk.nl">www.kabk.nl</a></p>
<p>Research Labs and Material Labs<br>
Research labs and material labs also form part of the academic-wide education programme for the bachelor’s. These labs are not mandatory, but are included in the<br>
IST programme as electives (see part 1.4.1 Structure of the programmes for more<br>
information on the IST programme). In order to explore and deepen the research aspects of the programme and the students’ development in artistic research, we organise a number of ‘research labs’. These labs are experimental and, on the<br>
whole, research-based interdisciplinary working groups, offered by one or more departments and/or research domains. In the labs, the research aspects of the programmes are explored and deepened by encouraging students to work together on particular themes with students and teachers from other disciplines.<br>
Material labs work from the leading paradigm ‘thinking with your hands’ of ‘thinking<br>
by doing’. They are initiated by the workshops and focus on researching materials and techniques in relation to the creative process. They offer space for experiment and practice, and encourage students to acquire a thorough knowledge of materials and mastering of techniques for the purpose of their artistic work.</p>
<p>Electives at Leiden University<br>
Through the Academy of Creative and Performing Arts, students may follow external electives at Leiden University or at the Royal Conservatoire as part of their IST programme (see part 1.4.1 Structure of the programmes for more information on the IST programme). Current information about all the external electives is available in the e-Prospectus: <a href="http://www.studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/en/">www.studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/en/</a>.</p>
<p>Internationalisation<br>
The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague strives to provide an international learning environment for its students, first, by creating an international atmosphere in the building, and second, by encouraging temporary tracks abroad in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>study exchanges</li>
<li>internships<br>
The advantage of a temporary track abroad is that it brings students into contact with different cultural and living environments and teaching methods. Students also learn<br>
to function in an international context, which will benefit their future careers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through a variety of mobility programmes, the European Union (EU) and the Dutch government offer a number of grants for students to follow part their programme or internship or conduct research abroad. In most cases, the foreign residency takes place in the third year of the programme. The length of stay varies from three months to a full semester.</p>
<p>Doing an internship is an obligatory part of the study programme in most departments. All students wanting to do an internship within the EU can make use of the Eramsus+ programme scholarship. Internships usually take between two and six months.</p>
<p>Affiliations<br>
•   Cumulus: The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague is a member of the international network of leading art schools, the ‘Cumulus International Association of Universities and Colleges of Art, Design and Media’, <a href="http://www.cumulusassociation.org">www.cumulusassociation.org</a>. This association provides opportunities for projects, among other things.<br>
•   ELIA: The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague is a member of European League of Institutes of the Arts. This association offers many opportunities for students looking to present their art and take part in projects. www.elia- <a href="http://artschools.org/members/index">artschools.org/members/index</a></p>
<p>Professional Practice Skills<br>
In the course of the study programmme, students work their way up to the level of a starting professional. In doing so, they increase the professionalism of their own work<br>
in their chosen profession or occupation. The Academy’s educational programmes<br>
can be seen as a foreshadowing of future professional practice and students encounter this practice in various forms and they master its various components.</p>
<p>The Academy considers it important that students become familiar with the professional aspects of being an artist or designer, so that by the end of their studies students have sufficient skills to enter the professional workplace. From the first year courses, preparation to professional practice is part of the curriculum. This is made even more explicit through projects, work presentations in internal and external exhibitions, internships (see 1.6.1 Procedures &gt; Internship procedure) and through lectures and workshops. The link is also made during visits to (and participation in) exhibitions and events. In the main phase of the Bachelor’s programmes, there is a strong focus on the position of the student in the professional field and the skills required to take that position successfully. The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague offers a mandatory course on Professional Practice Skills, which equips students for the art and design profession and offers insight into how to realise their ideas. This broad programme is facilitated by the different departments in their own way related to the needs of the specific disciplines. It works on developing knowledge and skills<br>
in the areas of project management, business development and professionalisation.</p>
<p>1.4.5 Academy-wide education</p>
<p>In addition to departmental programmes, Bachelor’s students participate in academy- wide courses. From the first year onwards, collaboration between students from different departments and disciplines is therefore actively encouraged.</p>
<p>Some components of academy-wide education form part of the compulsory programme. In these cases, the specific courses are included in the departmental</p>
<p>credit overviews. In other cases, academy-wide programmes may refer to elective subjects.</p>
<p>Besides the abovementioned courses that form part of the IST (see part 1.4.1<br>
Structure of the programmes for more information) and Research and Discourse (see<br>
1.4.4 Focus issues &gt; Research) the courses and subjects that are offered at an academy-wide level are:</p>
<p>•   The Propaedeutic Project week<br>
The Propaedeutic Project Week is an academy-wide project week for all first-<br>
year students. This week is about working across the boundaries of different disciplines in art education. The aim is to promote collaboration and strengthen connections between the different departments. The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague strives to stimulate an inspiring ‘open culture’ characterised by connections and engagement between individual experiences and skills. This project week is a compulsory component of the first year of all Bachelor’s programmes.</p>
<p>•   Studium Generale<br>
The activities of the Studium Generale (SG) are designed to broaden students’ knowledge and keep them up to date with cultural and social developments. During these activities, all students at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague<br>
are invited to look beyond the boundaries of their own disciplines in order to question current events taking place in the world around them and to engage<br>
with ideas from other disciplines. This helps them to develop a critical perspective on their own discipline and engage in dialogue with other students. The aim is to introduce students to fields that are not addressed directly within their own course, such as theatre, philosophy, poetry, film, sociology, invention, science, or a combination of these. In a largely semi-<br>
theoretical programme, students are encouraged to view their work from a different perspective and draw inspiration from other fields of knowledge. The exact content of the SG programme for 2018-2019 will be published on the website: <a href="http://www.studiumgeneralekabk.nl/">http://www.studiumgeneralekabk.nl/</a>. The Studium Generale is a compulsory component of all Bachelor’s programmes; the semester in which it is included in the programme can differ per department. Students from other years are encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>1.4.6 Quality assurance</p>
<p>Obviously, the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague is continuously striving to warrant and improve the quality of its education in the broadest sense of the term. Students, teachers, supporting staff and management are expected to get the best out of themselves, in order to create an optimal environment for higher art education. The Academy is characterised by a quality culture: we aim for excellence in every aspect of learning. We participate in an international peer group of like-minded art academies, to share experiences with quality enhancement policies and procedures. By quality assurance, we refer to all measures that the institution systematically applies to define, monitor and further improve the quality of our education and of the organization as a whole.</p>
<p>Accreditation<br>
Accreditation is a designation indicating that an educational programme meets the requirements set by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Achieving<br>
accreditation is a precondition for the recognition of diplomas, for the funding of programmes and for grant applications. An external committee reviews and evaluates the programmes and reports to the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO), the body that also grants accreditations. A list of accredited programmes is available on the NVAO website: <a href="http://www.nvao.net">www.nvao.net</a></p>
<p>An important part of the accreditation process, quality assurance involves continuous monitoring of the performance of an organisation and its education. This is achieved by holding interviews and evaluations (see below). If the outcomes of the assessments are negative, improvements are made.</p>
<p>The Royal Academy of Art’s Bachelor’s programmes and the Master’s programme in Type and Media were accredited in 2014. The Bachelor’s programme in Autonomous Fine Arts (ArtScience and Fine Arts) was assessed as ‘good’, while the Bachelor’s programme in Design (Graphic Design, Interactive/Media/Design, Interior<br>
Architecture and Furniture Design, Photography and Fashion and Textile) and the<br>
Master’s programme in Type and Media were assessed as ‘excellent’.</p>
<p>The Master’s programmes in ArtScience and Artistic Research were accredited in September 2013 as ‘excellent’. ‘Internationalisation’ was identified as a distinctive quality feature of the programmes (as a specialisation in the Master’s programme in Music). The Master Artistic Research is now part of the Master of Arts in Fine Art and Design which passed its initial accreditation in 2017.</p>
<p>The Master’s programme in Interior Architecture was accredited in 2015. The audit panel concluded that the programme was excellent; the NVAO confirmed that it met the required standards.</p>
<p>Quality assurance at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague<br>
Staff, students, alumni and professionals of the different departments are actively involved in internal quality assurance at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague.<br>
Great importance is attached to having high-quality policies, both throughout the Academy and within the departments. The Academy gathers opinions on the programmes and the programme results. Opinions are gathered internally, with</p>
<p>students and staff members, as well as externally, with alumni, committee members, key figures in the art and design worlds, internship companies and professional art institutions. These opinions are voiced through dialogue, discussions and surveys.</p>
<p>Examination Board<br>
The Examination Board is legally required (Article 7.12 Dutch Law on Higher<br>
Education and Scientific Research) and is the independent and competent body to certify that students fulfil all final qualifications required to obtain the diploma. It is responsible for the quality of the assessments and examinations, and it appoints the assessors/examiners. It is also responsible for decisions on requests for exemptions. All Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes share one Examination Board, which consists of teaching staff and at least one member external to the programmes concerned.</p>
<p>Satisfaction surveys<br>
Written and digital surveys are used to ask students about their level of satisfaction with the educational programme in general, as well as with regard to specific parts of<br>
the programme. Aspects addressed in the surveys include the level of the course,<br>
assessment and the study load. The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague has recently adopted and implemented an electronic system to conduct such surveys and produce the reports as easily and quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Participation in national satisfaction surveys<br>
The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague regularly participates in national satisfaction surveys concerning students’ evaluation of content and organisational practice in institutes of higher education in the arts.</p>
<p>Student panels/class representative meetings<br>
Within each programme, regular meetings are scheduled (at least once a year) between the head of department and class representatives, thus functioning as student panels. The class representatives also meet at least once a year with the director of the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague.</p>
<p>Departmental meetings<br>
Teachers and heads of departments meet regularly to discuss how the courses are run and the quality of the education. This information is then used to develop the<br>
programmes.</p>
<p>Study days<br>
The director, heads of departments and other staff members participate in study days several times a year, in order to discuss current developments within the academy<br>
and to develop new ideas.</p>
<p>External assessors<br>
Each year, renowned experts, artists and designers are involved in the final examinations as external assessors. They are asked about their experiences and findings in relation to the department. The departments use this information to<br>
develop their programmes.</p>
<p>Professional advisory committees<br>
A professional advisory committee (in Dutch, werkveldcommissie) has been established within each department to ensure compatibility with the professional field. There is also a professional advisory committee for the academy as a whole. These committees consist of respected individuals from the professional field who advise<br>
the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague and comment on the content of the programmes, the final objectives and the final level, as well as on developments in<br>
the field and what these mean for the Academy and its education.</p>
<p>Internship companies<br>
The companies at which students complete their internships are asked about their findings regarding the level of the students and their needs in the professional field.</p>
<p>Alumni studies<br>
For the past few years, alumni have been invited to complete a digital questionnaire or to talk to the alumni coordinator and/or the quality assurance department about<br>
their experiences and recommendations.</p>
<p>Exit surveys<br>
All students leaving the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague without a diploma are asked to complete a questionnaire. The information obtained from these surveys can<br>
prove useful for the development of the Academy’s education.</p>

<p>1.6 Regulations &amp; Procedures</p>
<p>1.6.1 Procedures</p>
<p>IST procedure<br>
General Procedures<br>
The departments provide detailed information about the IST procedure. Every department has its own IST coach or coaches to guide students through this process.<br>
Every student makes an IST plan, using the IST form. This plan describes the<br>
student’s proposed activities, their motivation and learning objectives. The plan should be discussed with an IST coach. In this discussion, the IST plan is evaluated</p>
<p>on the basis of whether it can function as a broadening and/or deepening of the study programme. The student can make a start on the plan once it has been approved. After the activity or activities have been carried out, a formal evaluation is conducted. If the IST-activities have been carried out under supervision of an external tutor, this tutor is responsible for the formal evaluation. The student is also asked to assess the learning results and activities. The IST-coach provides a final assessment. See <a href="http://www.kabk.nl">www.kabk.nl</a> for the IST form and the procedure.</p>
<p>Work carried out within the framework of the IST does not always form part of the collective assessment. This is the case, for example, when the IST involves an elective at Leiden University. In such situations, students are assessed externally and the coach only approves this assessment if it matches the IST plan. Credits are allocated after the collective assessments. See also the IST procedure provided by the department.</p>
<p>Practical information<br>
The IST programme covers 30 ECs that can be divided over four years of study. There is no strict target for how many credits a student should earn per semester, but it is recommended that students spread the credits over the semesters. Each department schedules time for the IST in the programme, although the exact scheduling can differ per department. Fulltime students tend to be exempt from compulsory study components on Wednesdays, which are reserved for students to deepen their knowledge and specialise in the curriculum. The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague labs are therefore scheduled for Wednesdays.</p>
<p>The modules organised by the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague are subject to change. Please see the website for current opportunities: <a href="http://www.kabk.nl">www.kabk.nl</a></p>
<p>External electives<br>
Through the Academy of Creative and Performing Arts, students may follow external electives at Leiden University or at the Royal Conservatoire. Current information about all the external electives is available in the e-Prospectus:<br>
<a href="http://www.studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/en/">www.studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/en/</a>. More information on the enrolment procedure is provided at <a href="http://www.hum.leiden.edu/creative-performing-arts">www.hum.leiden.edu/creative-performing-arts</a></p>
<p>Enrolment in an elective course at the Royal Conservatoire does not require registration as a guest student at Leiden University. If you wish to enrol, please contact R. Schneemann: <a href="mailto:acpa@hum.leidenuniv.nl">acpa@hum.leidenuniv.nl</a>.</p>
<p>Practicum Artium: electives for students from Leiden University and the Royal<br>
Academy<br>
Through the Academy of Creative and Performing Arts, students from Leiden<br>
University may take electives at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague and the Royal Conservatoire. From the current academic year onwards, Royal Academy of Art, The Hague students can also attend these classes. The electives are: painting, drawing, graphic design and photography. More information is available at the website and in the e-Prospectus of Leiden University: <a href="http://www.studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/en">www.studiegids.leidenuniv.nl/en</a>. If you wish to register, please contact the Academy’s coordinator for academic-wide education, Niki van Strien, via <a href="mailto:n.vanstrien@kabk.nl">n.vanstrien@kabk.nl</a>.</p>
<p>Internship procedure<br>
Preconditions for an internship<br>
Before a student can start an internship, their internship plan must be approved and they must have completed prior study components. In exceptional cases, the head of department may authorise an internship before the student has completed the prior<br>
study components. The necessary preparations must have been made during the<br>
period preceding the internship (e.g., preparation for attendance and return days to be held mid-way or at the end of the internship period).</p>
<p>Organisation of the internship<br>
The internship coordinator provides detailed information on the internship procedure. All the steps that are outlined by the internship coordinator are also indicated on the<br>
internship forms and constitute essential elements of an internship. No separate<br>
credits are allocated for these steps. An internship must comprise at least half a semester, up to a maximum of one semester.</p>
<p>Internship forms are available via the website (Portal &gt; download forms) and the Student Administration office. They should be completed before, during and after an internship. The forms include an internship contract and the assessment forms for the internship provider. The internship forms for students doing an internship in the Netherlands are available in Dutch and English. For students doing an internship abroad, English internship abroad forms are available. In cases where it is difficult to obtain an internship (e.g., ArtScience and Fine Arts), an internship can be replaced with other activities.</p>
<p>International internships<br>
Students wishing to do an internship in another European country can apply for an Erasmus+ scholarship. The minimum duration of an Erasmus+ internship is two months and the maximum duration is one semester. The number of ECs for the internship will be decided by the department. Students wishing to do an internship abroad can find all of the information and forms to be completed on the website, under ‘International’.</p>
<p>Internationalisation procedures<br>
International exchange<br>
All students at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague have the opportunity to study abroad for a semester. Students can choose from a pool of European and non-<br>
European partners, in consultation with their head of department. Students can study<br>
abroad for one semester and gain 30 ECs. The department decides on the year and the period during which students are permitted study abroad. Students studying at an<br>
Erasmus partner institution can apply for a scholarship. All information regarding the<br>
application procedure and the list of partners can be found on the website, under<br>
‘International’.</p>
<p>Exemptions procedure<br>
At a student’s request and on the recommendation of the assessment committee, the<br>
Examination Board can grant an exemption for one or more study components on the</p>
<p>basis of a certificate, diploma, testimonial or other document that proves that the student has already met the requirements of the relevant component.</p>
<p>The period of validity of any exemption granted is unlimited, unless the content of the relevant study component is altered due to changes to the Education and Examination Regulations. If an exemption is granted, the student will receive proof of the exemption.</p>
<p>Procedure<br>
The detailed procedure can be found in the appendix of the Education and<br>
Examination Regulations (see Exemption protocol). A student must submit his or her request for exemption to the lecturer/invigilator before the third meeting relating to a<br>
subject in a semester at the latest. In order to apply for an exemption, students must<br>
complete a form that can be found on the student portal or printed at the Student Administration office. The request for exemption must be accompanied by supporting documentation. The lecturer/invigilator will evaluate the request and advise the head<br>
of the department concerned on the request and supply the supporting documentation. The head of department will ensure that the lecturer/invigilator has based his/her recommendation on solid arguments. If this is the case, the head of department will adopt the recommendation of the lecturer/invigilator.</p>
<p>The recommendation will then be made to the Examination Board. The form signed by the head of department, together with the supporting documentation, must be submitted to the Student Administration office. Once the Board has made a positive recommendation, the exemption will be officially granted. Student Administration will register the granted exemptions and inform the student by means of an adjusted study progress overview. If the request for exemption is rejected by the Examination Board, the Board will duly inform the relevant head of department and the lecturer/invigilator, stating the reasons for the rejection and asking the head of department to re-assess the exemption request.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the student is responsible for all steps until and including submitting the request, including all required documentation and signatures, to the Student Administration office.</p>
<p>Appeals and objections<br>
The Royal Academy has various bodies with which objections can be lodged against decisions that have been taken by the Academy during the study process: the Board<br>
of Appeal for Examinations and the Complaints Committee. In addition, there is a<br>
national Appeals Tribunal for Higher Education (<a href="http://www.cbho.nl">www.cbho.nl</a>).</p>
<p>Procedure<br>
In the context of protecting students’ legal rights, the Royal Academy has set up a digital complaints desk to receive all student complaints, objections or appeals, forward them correctly and ensure that they are handled properly. Complaints written in Dutch or English can be sent to: <a href="mailto:klachtenloket@kabk.nl">klachtenloket@kabk.nl</a>. All formal notices of objection should be sent exclusively to the complaints office and should be<br>
addressed by the complainant to the body that took the decision (the Examination<br>
Board, the faculty management, the Executive Board or the Complaints Committee).</p>
<p>Formal objections should be submitted within six weeks of date on which the student was notified of the decision to which he or she objects.</p>

<p>Content of the Study</p>
<p>The department of fine art at the KABK aims at aligning the past of fine art with its present and its future. We embrace history and traditions and root our discourse firmly in the contemporary. At the same time we research and imagine the future of fine art as an indispensable contributor to culture, society and economy. We try to equip future artists with skills, competencies, strategies and confidence to shape their future and the future of the arts.</p>
<p>Students get the opportunity to expand their artistic and other skills, such as collaboration, communication, self-management, observing from unexpected angles, decision making, critical reflection and critical distance to yourself - skills that are of high value for the arts and many other professional careers in the future.</p>
<p>Making art can be an isolating process. As a fine art department we provide the community and the critical context that breaks this isolation. Through this community, we sustain a meaningful relationship to life and to higher art education that is at once pragmatic and idealistic. It is this collective ethos that strengthens our commitment to maintaining the high- energy of creative ambition and engagement that continue to attract students and staff to work with us.</p>
<p>The individual learning of the student is the kernel of our teaching strategies, which are<br>
•   Independence: encourage students to work independently out of experience and experiments, with an understanding for the quality of the making, the context of the work and its strategical position, and to learn how to develop and trust intuition</p>
<p>•   Guidance: support students through individual feedback and guidance</p>
<p>•   Groups: foster discussions in peer situations to enable students to benefit from the context of a group<br>
•   Workshops: create an awareness for the wide options of techniques and technologies, relevant for the production of artworks</p>
<p>•   Presentations: challenge students to rehearse the presentation of work as exhibitions and as verbal presentation<br>
•   Seminars, lectures and reading groups: provide an entrance to art history and art related theories as crucial contextual knowledge<br>
•   Theory and practice: link theory and practice through team teaching, involving teachers with experience from both fields<br>
•   Research: help students to understand research as an essential part of the artistic process and encourage to play with it<br>
•   Professional context: assist students to understand, what roles artists play in our societies, what economical, cultural, social and political conditions they have and enable them to design their future and that of the arts</p>
<p>40 artists and six art historians, art theorists and artists with a strong theoretical and research-oriented practice support students in their learning. With respect to their own practice and interests, they divide into three groups: sculpture, painting &amp; printing and autonoom. Autonoom indicates artistic interests which can differ from those in the other<br>
groups, more oriented towards concepts, performance, time based work and other strategies. Students choose one of the groups as a home base for their learning from year two onwards. Joining a section does not limit students in their choice for artistic realisations. Students can change their affiliation to a group in the course of their studies. form the critical inquiry group and develop and deliver a theory based programme. All four groups develop the curriculum in close contact to each other.</p>
<p>The curriculum spans over a period of four years and is constructed out of the following blocks at all year levels. Blocks contain specific courses.<br>
•   studio practice<br>
•   professional practice<br>
•   research practice<br>
•   critical inquiry<br>
•   electives / IST</p>
<p>The curriculum is delivered in three pathways:<br>
•   full time<br>
•   part time<br>
•   double degree</p>
<p>Full time and part time mode lead to the same degree. The learning appointments for part time students are arranged to accommodate their specific living conditions and the conditions of their jobs, where necessary. A greater proportion of independent learning is expected from them. The harmonisation between the full time curriculum and the part time curriculum is currently under development. In some instances a complete synchronisation might nit be achieved this year.<br>
The double degree pathway leads students to the achieve two bachelor degrees in parallel within four years, one in fine art and one in art history,  The BA in art history is provided through the Art, Media and Society programme at Leiden University. A system of exemptions from curriculum elements has been developed to guarantee the validity for the award of the bachelor degree. In many cases the fine art elements of the curriculum resemble those for the part time students.</p>
<p>The double degree programme and the part time mode are not open for incoming exchange students.</p>
<p>studio practice<br>
The studio remains the nucleus for all learning and teaching. In the studio the process of learning itself is made visible, for the student as well as for others. We see the studio as a space, where you can leave a thought behind and it is still there, when you return the next morning. The studio is the ‘flight simulator’ for professional practice. The studio in the context of an art school allows students to establish a critical and supportive community, and builds future networks and opportunities for a contemporary art practitioner.<br>
The core of the learning in the years two, three and four of the BA-Fine Art curriculum is studio practice. Increasingly more time and credits are allocated for individual artistic work. The development of ideas and its transformation into works of art and artistic strategies stands in the foreground.</p>
<p>Dedicated studio spaces are made available and highly qualified artists follow students with support, guidance and critical feedback. Artist-teachers provide critique and support in regular individual tutorials and in group activities. Students are strongly advised to engage in group activities and discussions as a necessary counterbalance to the development of their individual work.</p>
<p>professional practice<br>
Art is a highly individual practice and can often have a high degree of self reflection and self reference: but it is always a professional practice. The role of the artists has changed over the centuries and keeps changing with an accelerating speed in contemporary times. An art market has blossomed which provides fortunes for some investors, dealers and selected artists. Collecting works of art can be a cultural and an economic act at the same time. The desire for culture and art grows as the continuously increasing number of people visiting</p>
<p>exhibitions, biennials and festivals shows, leaving a substantial residue for businesses and tourism. National and regional governments and city councils have developed ingenious systems to support the arts. With this as a backdrop we understand professional practice as the necessity to understand the economy of the artists now and in future.<br>
Through a programme of lectures and seminars we want to enable the artists of the future to understand their own economy and their contribution to the economy of our societies, rather than waiting for a volatile market to pay attention and the sheer skill to attract subsidies. We invite experienced artists, curators, museum directors, collectors, gallerists, economists, legal advisors and specialists from the wide range of science and society to present their thoughts. At the same time we engage students in the thinking of the many artists initiatives and collectives active in the Netherlands and abroad and aim to provide access to alternative thinkers, political activists and institutional critique. Furthermore students exercise in organising a few group shows. The aim of professional practice is to pay tribute to the changing roles of artists and to enable the reinvention of our economy as artists.</p>
<p>research practice</p>
<p>Research practice gives students the opportunity to get acquainted with various modes of research in and through the arts. Through seminars, projects and guest lectures by artistic researchers students will understand what importance research has for the production and perception of art and how art practice and art works contribute to our knowledge as mankind and societies, on eye level with and as an important counterpart to science. Students are provided with the opportunity to play with various notions of artistic research to inform the decision if they want to pursue research as artist actively and in what form.</p>
<p>critical inquiry<br>
Art history, art theory and reflections on artistic research firm under the heading critical inquiry. Understanding the history of the arts as embedded in the history of our societies is crucial to maintain a reflected stand as a contemporary artist. The contemporary discourse in art related theories inevitably provides the resonating body and the timbre for every artist today.<br>
All students follow a mandatory programme of lectures, seminars and projects in art history and theory and in relation to artistic research. A written thesis is part of the final exam. Studio teachers and theory teachers work in close contact to each other, among others in the docking station project.</p>
<p>In addition to the mandatory programme students can join additional reading groups as electives to go deeper into specific issues.  They can also sign up for a wide range of offers provided by Leiden University.</p>
<p>electives / IST<br>
It is a tradition at KABK that students spend a certain amount of time of their studies to widen their horizon beyond their discipline. This is called the individual study track (IST). IST projects are offered academy wide and foster collaboration between the ten departments. As part of the IST programme students can also get access to many offers made by Leiden University. In addition to this the fine art department has developed a range of electives, relevant for the studies of fine art. Students in year two and three must choose at least 2</p>
<p>electives or IST offers per semester. The final exam project contains 12 credits of IST as individual learning and practice.</p>

<p>Content of the study</p>
<p>The ArtScience Interfaculty offers an interdisciplinary Bachelor’s and Master’s programme that fosters curiosity-driven research as an approach to the creation of art. The programme regards art and science as a continuum and promotes the development of new art forms and artistic languages.</p>
<p>The ArtScience Interfaculty is an interdisciplinary department situated between and embedded within both the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague and the Royal Conservatoire. Classes include scientific and theoretical knowledge, sensory perception, interdisciplinary composition, hands-on production, performance training, collaborative projects and critical thinking. We focus largely on individual coaching. ArtScience allows students to code and create never-before heard sounds and never-before seen images, to establish immersive environments, to design new forms of interaction with their audiences and explore media that have never before been used by artists. Most importantly, students are invited to re-invent<br>
art, as needed in this century.</p>
<p>Tutoring and Coaching<br>
Studying at the ArtScience Interfaculty, Bachelor or Master, is concentrated around the individual development of an experimental approach towards the arts in the broadest sense<br>
— ideally crossing the borders of them into unknown territory. Apart from the offered courses<br>
and abilities to extend knowlegde from other departments and institutions in art, science and humanities, studies at ArtScience rely on individual and collective exploration. The study<br>
programme supports this in a number of ways. Central is the personal coach every ArtScience student consults. With the coach, a student plans their study plan, research, individual projects, choice of internal and external courses and everything else concerning artistic and professional progress. Above that, there are other means of interaction to guide students in their individual development: the Manic Mondays in the second semester where<br>
lectures, presentations and other activities are organised around communal lunch with the whole faculty, and where students have the chance to talk to other teachers than their regular coaches. The presentations, where students every year show their progress in individual<br>
work by presenting their etudes, prototypes and sketches (semester 1 and midterm<br>
presentations) and final work of the year (second semester presentations). For Bachelors there are periodic Bachelor Meetings per year to discuss ongoing issues. For Masters there<br>
are frequent Master Meetings which are central to the Master programme. Students present<br>
and discuss their research progress there intensively. During the graduation year, Bachelor and Master students organise their own Preview Show in the second semester, from funding to location, from general curational theme to public relations — being their final test before<br>
graduation. For the thesis, graduating students are offered a ‘Thesis Boost’ in two parts in the<br>
second semester: individual guidance by expert Merel Boers.</p>
<p>With the exception of some introductory and theoretical courses, the ArtScience Interfaculty has an ‘open curriculum’. Within constraints, students navigate individually through the modules offered within the Interfaculty and its affiliated departments and institutions.<br>
At the Interfaculty faculty, there are five forms of instruction:<br>
•   Theoretical Courses<br>
•   Workshop-Style Courses<br>
•   Labs<br>
•   Research projects<br>
•   Individual Study Track</p>
<p>With the exception of the first-year courses and theory courses, students always have a choice between several options. For additional information and the complete schedule, please refer to the Interfaculty website.</p>

<p>Content &amp; structure</p>
<p>The professionals of today are authors, in the sense that they are makers, finders and creators. They are able to practice the profession in the traditional sense, while contributing to the evolution of the discipline.</p>
<p>Contemporary photographers are entrepreneurs who know how to generate a base of support for their work. They have an extensive frame of reference for the field and the discipline, particularly in an international context. They have a vision for the position of the discipline in the world of art and culture, as well as in social developments. They are aware of the many platforms that offer opportunities, including social media and the internet in general, as well as traditional platforms, including journals, posters and other printed media. They<br>
have extensive networks, and they are able to collaborate with others.</p>
<p>Structure<br>
In the first year of programme (the propaedeutic year), students receive a thorough introduction to these areas. Thereafter, students choose to complete the remaining three</p>
<p>years in either Documentary or Fiction, positioning their work in one of these areas based on subsequent choices.</p>
<p>Full-time / part-time<br>
The content of the part-time programme in Photography is the same as that of the full-time programme, but with a different organisation and structure. To date, no internship period is<br>
included in the programme. Part-time students must therefore engage in independent career<br>
orientation, in addition to the programme. With permission, part-time students may follow parts of the full-time curriculum.</p>
<p>Graduates are expected to meet the following qualifications:</p>
<p>•   Students are able to develop and implement distinctive imagery in a meaningful way resulting from their research and artistic ambition (creative ability)<br>
•   Students are able to contextualise and critically reflect on their own work and on<br>
work of others, and they are capable to utilise external feedback and positively implement this in their own work (capacity for critical reflection)<br>
•   Students are able to continuously investigate and analyse their own ambition, vision and working methods as well as the professional practice around them. Their innovate position constantly challenges the photographic medium in general (capacity<br>
for growth and innovation)<br>
•   Students are able to organise an inspiring and professional working ambiance. They are capable of practically organising their profession and are ambitious in marketing their work (entrepreneurial and organisational ability)<br>
•   Students know where to reach and how engage their audience and clients. Students are able to present their vision, research and work in a convincing manner,<br>
as well written as orally (communicative ability)<br>
•   Students understand how their work relates to the professional artistic and societal context (external awareness) Students understand group dynamics and are able to make independent artistic contributions to a collaborative work. Students are also capable of organising collaborating partners for their own practice (capacity for<br>
collaboration).</p>

<p>Content &amp; structure</p>
<p>The Graphic Design department educates its students to become critical thinkers and versatile practitioners who develop outstanding concepts for visual communication. Its world- wide reputation is fuelled by the high level and thorough education, the investigative and conceptual approach in teaching, as well as the excellent quality in the field of typeface design and typography. At the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, students are encouraged not only to find answers to the problems of tomorrow and the rapidly evolving new-media landscape, but also to pose questions on the social responsibilities of a contemporary designer.</p>
<p>Description of the study programme<br>
The Graphic Design department educates students to become critical thinkers and versatile practitioners who develop outstanding concepts for visual communication. Ideal graduates are investigative designers who are fully aware of current affairs, choose their media wisely<br>
and master both traditional and new media. Graduates excel in their professional careers through their extraordinary conceptual and visual abilities, extensive knowledge of the</p>
<p>profession and the world, strong technological curiosity and highly developed social engagement.</p>
<p>The department offers an extensive curriculum. The programme is built around four main courses: Design, Interaction, Image and Typography. The excellent quality in the field of typeface design and typography distinguishes the programme from other graphic design studies.</p>

<p>Content &amp; structure</p>
<p>Interactive Media Design (I/M/D) is a full-time programme that trains students to become designers of interactive concepts and processes. I/M/D lays down the link between people and processes as well as those between people and products. Ideas are our main product and that’s why students at I/M/D are taught to think in non-media specific terms, which are later translated into a concept and meta-medial, multi-medial or cross-medial applications. Interactive/Media/Design is offered as a full-time programme that emphasises research and self-development. The courses are structured according to a logical pedagogical line of development, which does not recognise sharp boundaries. It is unlikely that students would ever be able to stop learning or disregard anything that might be useful in the development of their interests. The programme resembles a relatively fluid scale, allowing for acceleration of the learning curve at almost any stage.</p>
<p>The structure of the programme can be divided into five major phases:<br>
•   Skill development<br>
•   Advanced skill application<br>
•   Research development<br>
•   Exploration of the professional domain</p>
<p>•   Self-development</p>

<p>Content &amp; structure</p>
<p>The discipline Interior Architecture and Furniture Design is populated by product and spatial designers who regard space, in the wider sense of the word, as their field of expertise. This field covers a wider area than that of just the interior or furniture, and the designers also focus on other objects and products, and on public and open space. They increasingly cross the traditional boundaries of their discipline and explore other domains, think cross- disciplinary, establish interconnections and always try to find the larger context. With a curious attitude they continuously question, search and fight for their position and that of the discipline.</p>
<p>The four-year programme of the BA Interior Architecture/ Furniture Design consists of three phases: the propaedeutic phase, the main phase and the graduation phase. Each phase has a specific mission. The line followed by these missions is that of crosspollination (Year 1), depth and connection (Years 2 and 3) and positioning (Year 4). This chronological structure<br>
is elaborated into four learning tracks, which constitute the domains that are addressed in each of the study years. These four domains are Design, Morphology and Research Labs, Media and Materials and Knowledge and Context. The curriculum is based on principles of experimentation and research. In each study year, research (by design) focuses on a specific area or current topic, based on a solid historical and cultural foundation and the potential efforts for interpreting and integrating this basis in design.</p>

<p>Content &amp; structure</p>
<p>Textiles and fashion can be regarded as a visual language reflecting the spirit of the time, coupled to materials, craft and tradition. Finding a personal balance between textiles and fashion is essential. An important guideline for the Textiles and Fashion programme at the KABK is the history of historical costumes and folklore. Developing a personal style, a way of working and a personal statement in all of the facets of the textile and fashion profession is thoroughly explored.</p>
<p>The objective of the study programme is to train students to be independent and professional designers. We guide their individual development process in a semiprofessional context. What is unique about KABK is that the Fashion Design and Textile Design courses are<br>
integrated into one study programme. However, each specialisation has a separate approach and trajectory, allowing students to graduate in either Fashion or Textile. This ensures interaction and unique opportunities for creative cross-pollination, which gives this course a specific identity.</p>
<p>Structure<br>
After the first joint semester in the propaedeutic year, the textile and fashion specialisations separate into two different programmes. Students are required to choose one of these programmes. Each programme is characterised by extensive and intensive research,<br>
supported by theoretical subjects designed to provide students with the required content-<br>
based skills.</p>
<p>Each academic year is divided into clusters which each represent a specific domain in the programme and become more refined and distinctive with each study year.</p>
<p>These clusters are:<br>
•   Design I: textile design, fashion design<br>
•   Design II: technical design (textile) , technical design (fashion)<br>
•   Visualisation: visual development, photography<br>
•   Drawing: model drawing, 2D forms and colour studies, fashion drawing<br>
•   Theory: art history, fashion, textile and design history, thesis<br>
•   Other: internship, Individual Study Track</p>

<p>The Type and Media Master is a full-time one year course that gives participants the possibility of delving deeper in type design for different media: not only type for print, but also for film, television, video and interactive media. Although we live in an increasingly pictorial culture, type design and typography have lost none of their value.</p>
<p>Structure<br>
Type and Media is a full-time one year Master program. Its schedule can therefore incorporate every day of the week. At the beginning of the course, each student establishes<br>
an individual study-plan in consultation with the permanent faculty.<br>
Because of the international character of the course, it is taught primarily in English. The academic year is divided into two semesters, with the second semester divided in turn into<br>
two parts. At the end of the first semester and in the first part of the second, all assignments<br>
that have been undertaken are evaluated. In addition to the assignments specific to this course, students can follow the calligraphy and the lettering and type divisions of the regular course in Graphic Design. Those subjects distinguish this regular course at the Royal<br>
Academy from other academies, both in the Netherlands and abroad.</p>

a wide-ranging exploration of a spatial context undergoing change. Wide-ranging here means that through observation, research and theoretical study, students chart and analyse a whole<br>
array of issues that are relevant to the spatial change that the context is undergoing. That wide range consists not only of spatial aspects but also of social, historical and ecological issues at play in the wider surroundings. After setting up and carrying out their investigation, the INSIDE students hone their skills in using the acquired knowledge to determine essential qualities that are of decisive importance for the spatial changes taking place. They then learn<br>
to incorporate those qualities in a spatial proposal grounded in a realistic perspective and in their social implications.</p>
<p>The INSIDE course is structured in a similar way to a research and design office. The main features of the course are the Studios in which students complete the entire process of a research and design project: orientation, research (through design), analysis, concept development, design (through research), presentation and evaluation. In the first year students are allotted four to eight weeks (comparable to a competition submission) or eighteen weeks (comparable to a regular commission) for the main projects in the Studios. Within the research and design process, various aspects are explored in depth in four parallel programmes: Theory, Flows, Skills and Travel. These programmes form an integral part of the design process in practice, but they are given added emphasis during the INSIDE course in relation to the Studio projects, and are supervised by specialist tutors. In this way, the analysis of the dynamic nature of a spatial context undergoing change is scrutinized closely in Flows, while the various theoretical aspects of a project are explored in Theory. An introduction to specific skills required in a project and to the approach of a particular tutor is offered in Skills, and relevant projects are visited in Travel.<br>
In the second year a Graduation Studio is organised to assist students in drawing up individual graduation projects. Students work independently and cover the entire process of orientation,</p>
<p>research (through design), analysis, concept development, design (through research) and presentation by themselves, under the individual supervision of the tutors.</p>

<p>The master’s programme ArtScience, like the bachelor’s programme, is based on the concept of the open curriculum. Because the master students are admitted on the basis of a specific research plan and because two years is too short to familiarize themselves with the Interfaculty before making choices, this research plan is translated into a study plan together with the coaches. This study plan maps out the individual path of the student through the teaching modules on offer within the Interfaculty and related departments and institutions.</p>
<p>The ArtScience Interfaculty offers five forms of instruction: research projects, labs, individual coaching, theoretical courses and workshop-style courses. These activities are open to Master as well as Bachelor students.<br>
There are seven different ArtScience labs, each of which is a combination of a laboratory, a production facility and a working ensemble of teachers, students, alumni and guests.<br>
Each lab is also a platform to offer coaching and space for projects by individual students,<br>
and a channel for the accumulation, documentation and dissemination of their research results and artworks. The aim is to gradually integrate the research proposals of the Master students with this new lab structure.<br>
Part of the study trajectory can consist of courses outside of the Interfaculty. Likely choices<br>
are courses offered elswhere at the Conservatoire, the Academy and the MediaTechnology<br>
Master of Leiden University, but other choices in Leiden or at other universities are also possible. In the past, students have followed courses in Sonology, Singing, Percussion, Photography, Print Making, Art History, Philosophy, Electronics, Sociology, Bio-informatics, Art and Genomics and Medical Anatomy. We would like to encourage students to explore other possibilities and surprise us.</p>
<p>Self-study and coaching<br>
Every Master student has two teachers who coach the individual work, reflect on it together with the student, offer a context for it, suggest literature and other sources and often assist in solving practical problems. A considerable amount of time within the Master’s programme is reserved for individual work and selfstudy.</p>
<p>Master Meetings<br>
Master Meetings are held approximately twice a month. They are gatherings of all Master students under the guidance of Arthur Elsenaar and Eric Kluitenberg. These meetings focus on students presenting their research results in spoken and written form and on discussing<br>
matters of methodology. Students will be helped to develop a critical context for their projects<br>
and to structure their research process.</p>
<p>Presentations and evaluations<br>
Collective presentations of individual projects are organised at the end of eich semester. The mid-term presentations in December/January concentrate more on the research process. In<br>
June, students are expected to show a finished artistic work that will be evaluated in the<br>
context of the research, with the general competences for the Master’s programme in mind.<br>
At the end of May the graduates of the Bachelor’s and the Master’s organise a public preview<br>
of the final exam projects. The remaining month from the preview to the exam can be used for rehearsals, fine-tuning and other enhancements on the basis of experiences from the<br>
public preview.</p>
<p>Courses and ECTS<br>
Credit Points (ECTS points) are assigned two times a year, at the end of each semester and before the presentations. Each credit point represents 28 hours of ‘study load’. Students should earn a total of 60 credit points per year. Part of the courses are obligatory, other<br>
courses can be chosen regarding certain rules and besides that there are a number of credit points for elective courses or alternative study related activities (this is called the individual study track (IST) or portfolio).</p>

<p>The Master Artistic Research is an intensive two-year study program aimed at an international group of students working in the field of visual art, who also have an interest in research processes and critical reflection within their art practice. The MAR is a collaboration between the Royal Academy of Art and the Royal Conservatory, both in The Hague, who together make up the University of the Arts The Hague.</p>
<p>The Master Artistic Research seeks to educate artists to become autonomous, critically aware artistic researchers, and the constantly developing program places at its center the exploration of each student’s personal creative trajectory, the production that defines this, and critical reflection on the processes, inspirations, and material results of this. Creativity is defined as a researching process where results are necessarily unpredictable, but where critical reflection can open up the complexity of this within the aesthetic, social, political, and historical field. Emphasis is also placed on extending classical research skills in all areas, such as the ability to gather relevant material; to undertake close reading, listening, and looking; to locate and understand connections within a matrix of research or archival materials; and on understanding how the materials of art practice might transmit their meanings.<br>
At the Master Artistic Research, we are open to a wide interpretation of what it means to be an artist, and welcome practices that touch on other disciplines, and those that are collaborative. Our link with the Royal Conservatory also often attracts visual artists for whom sound or music are important aspects of their practice.</p>
<p>The core teaching team is made up of artists and theorists, and supported by an extensive and international guest program of artists, curators, poets, musicians, and theorists. Specialist teaching clusters around the Research Days, delivered as a mix of lectures,</p>
<p>seminars, workshops, and site visits, with both individual and group teaching. The program also includes excursions, projects with other academies, and department exhibitions, which are important for professional development and for sharing and testing research results with a wider public.</p>
<p>The Master Artistic Research has its own dedicated studio spaces, where much of the core teaching takes place. Emphasis is placed on the studios as both independent workplaces and a stable community environment for our international group of students, a place to foster a strong peer-group and a secure environment for artistic experimentation. Students also have access to the extensive workshop facilities of the Royal Academy and as well as the practice rooms, electronics workshop, and library of the Royal Conservatory.</p>

<p>2.3.5 Master of Arts in Fine Art and Design – Industrial Design</p>
<p>The Master of Arts in Fine Art &amp; Design - Industrial Design programme is a two-year full-time master for designers who want to use applied design to make a conscious contribution to the world of today and tomorrow. For designers who are keen to hone their creativity in order to work within a complex interplay of factors and find a ‘solution’ in the form of a distinctive and elegant design. For designers looking to operate as professionals on the industrial playing field; who want to investigate it, to question it critically and help to give it shape.<br>
The Master Industrial Design unites the technical and production aspects of industrial design with its substantive, cultural and social significance.<br>
This study programme has been taught since 1950 at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague<br>
(KABK) and is the oldest recognised course in the field of Design and Industrial Design in the Netherlands. Prominent teachers and students include Gerrit Rietveld, Frans de La Haye and Renny Ramakers.<br>
The programme has been recently transformed from a Postgraduate Course into a two-year<br>
full-time master’s programme. Both the schedule and the condensed curriculum leave time for a professional practice.</p>

<p>NON LINEAR NARRATIVE analyses the relations of complex socio-political issues, and how they can be communicated to a broad audience.<br>
The programme repositions the graphic design discipline in the changing professional<br>
landscape and extends it with new responsibilities towards society. Key objective is to educate critical thinkers, who master new technologies to tell meaningful narratives addressing the world’s social, economic and environmental challenges. Students will not only<br>
study parts of philosophy and media theory, but also learn practical skills in design, computer programming, film editing, 3D modelling and virtual reality.</p>
<p>The programme is based on strengthening engagement with the broad social, political and cultural context in which the designer works and with which she or he relates. This context also has consequences for the role and responsibilities as a designer.</p>
<p>The graduation profile pushes the boundaries of the discipline of graphic designer, not only towards other design disciplines (interactive designers, product designers, film-makers), but also towards traditional, more academic disciplines, such as sociology, political science, anthropology and economics. It seeks to engage with practitioners of these disciplines, as well as integrating the insights and methods of these disciplines in the non-linear narrative design process.<br>
The programme focuses fully on design as research and research as design. The programme involves an increasing degree of self-direction on the students’ part, within a<br>
clear structure that provides stability and guidance. During the first year, students work on a<br>
joint research theme. In the second year, students’ work is devoted fully to a personal project plan, which is supported by a substantive teaching programme.</p>

<p>Photography &amp; Society is a brand new, two-year master programme offered by the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (KABK) starting September, 2018. The Master’s programmePhotography &amp; Society at the KABK educates socially-engaged photographers of the 21st century, who possess an active interest in the technological, political, environmental and social role of the photograph.</p>
<p>The core of Photography &amp; Society is image-making, at the same time the programme will challenge you to foster encounters beyond photographic practice and utilize photography as a means to take part in global debate. We enable you to mediate the relationship between image and society. These transformational demands can only be met if photographers are educated in how photographs are created, presented, discussed, used, and documented.</p>
<p>As a Photography &amp; Society student you are educated to master the full distribution chain, seamlessly moving from concept to making work and its presentation in various, often novel, forms.</p>

<p>2.4 PhDarts (In cooperation with the University of Leiden)</p>
<p>The University of the Arts The Hague is one of the few art schools in the Netherlands that can offer a PhD route: PhDArts, international doctorate programme.</p>
<p>About PhDArts</p>
<p>PhDArts, a collaboration between Leiden University Academy of Creative and Performing Arts and the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (KABK) in The Hague, is a high-level international doctorate programme in visual art and design. PhDArts functions as a platform for artists who regard theoretical reflection and artistic practice as intrinsically related and complementary. A unique programme in the Netherlands, PhDArts creates new possibilities for art and its practitioners through questioning and breaking down existing boundaries between art theory and art practice.</p>
<p>PhD candidates follow individual research trajectories, guided by a team of supervisors. Besides this, the PhD candidates participate in a doctoral study programme, which consists of lectures, seminars, trainings and workshops. Together with supervisors, staff members and guest teachers, the doctoral candidates form an inspiring and challenging research environment.</p>
<p>Certain conditions apply to the PhDArts doctorate. The first condition for acceptance into the programme is a high level of artistry. Secondly, each applicant should present a clear research theme, as well as a research plan. In addition, the discursive context of the research should be clearly described. The PhDArts doctorate is a long- term research commitment that generally encompasses four years.</p>
<p>Researchers are expected to be in the vanguard of their fields of research. The research should contribute to knowledge about art/design, as well as to the international discourse in the field of research.</p>
<p>Artistic research</p>
<p>Artistic research, or research in and through art, is an inseparable part of the art or design practice of the researcher. Therefore, there is a unique relationship between the artist/designer, the research method and the outcome of the research. This research is made possible by the artistic practice of the researcher, and, conversely, the artist/designer develops his work through the research. The outcome of the research is an artistic product, combined with a discursive product (i.e. the dissertation), which does justice to the artistic product.<br>
The discursive text will provide insight into the departure points, methods and results of the research. The artistic work itself will be deliberative, containing reflection as an integral component. Research that fulfils these conditions will be innovative and relevant to<br>
contemporary developments in the world of art and design.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic relationship between work and text in this type of research, the outcome of PhD trajectory cannot be restricted to any particular format. Therefore, PhDArts does not specify a fixed ratio between the written dissertation and the artistic production.</p>

<p>2.5. Lectorates</p>
<p>Lecotorate Art Theory and Practice</p>
<p>The lectorate Art Theory &amp; Practice (KTP), headed by Prof. Dr. Janneke Wesseling, started in 2007. The lectorate KTP engages with the integration of theory and practice in art education. It has, among other things, initiated the Art Research Programme, which consists of interdisciplinary courses and stimulates research and critical reflection. Under the chairmanship of Janneke Wesseling, theory teachers have developed a specific outlook on theory education at the art academy. This outlook also informs the education curricula in general. In 2015, the lectorate initiated a Research Group consisting of tutors of the KABK who engage themselves with research in their practice. The lectorate organises symposia, workshops and lectures with various partners. For more information and an overview of courses and activities, please visit <a href="http://lectoraatktp.nl">lectoraatktp.nl</a> or contact Lotte Betting (coordinator lectorate Art Theory &amp; Practice).</p>
<p>Content and structure</p>
<p>The lectorate Art Theory &amp; Practice organises the Art Research Programme for motivated and talented Bachelor students. The Art Research Programme consists of a series of courses, to which students can apply by submitting a letter of motivation. Generally, the courses are taught by PhDArts doctoral candidates and sometimes guest teachers are invited. Also, some courses organised by the Academy of Creative and Performing<br>
Arts (ACPA) of Leiden University are open to Bachelor students of the Royal Academy of Art through the Art Research Programme.</p>
<p>The courses vary widely in thematic focus, but they all share an emphasis on research in relation to art practice. Moreover, all courses in the Art Research Programme are interdisciplinary and not connected to one specific department of the academy. In each course, students from different departments work together, and in some cases they collaborate with students from the Royal Conservatoire and Leiden University.</p>
<p>Application deadlines and new courses are announced on the website of the lectorate and through additional communication channels of the Royal Academy of Art, the academy’s website, and mailings. The courses can be taken within the framework of the Individual Study Track (IST), in consultation with the IST coach.</p>
<p>Courses and ECTS</p>
<p>Semester I:</p>
<p>•   Writing Art: 6 ECTS</p>
<p>The course will familiarise students with diverse ways of writing about art. This is achieved through a series of lectures by experts and through workshops in which students will experiment with different approaches to ‘Writing Art’.</p>
<p>Semester II: to be determined.</p>
<p>Lectorate Design</p>
<p>Dr. Alice Twemlow was appointed lector Design at the KABK in September 2017. The lectorate Design aims to serve as a dynamic catalyst or provocation for design-focused research activity within the KABK learning environment and beyond. Inherent in this mission is the imperative to surface, nurture and promote a robust design-focused research culture within the KABK and via the channels that connect KABK and Leiden University.</p>
<p>The working title for the lectorate is ‘’Design and the Deep Future’’, to allow for investigation of such topics as: geological time and design; waste and trash; dematerialization of design; circular economy; repair; non-humans and design; digital detritus; design criticism;<br>
speculative and critical design and so on. Engagement with these and other issues will be further augmented through research projects, exhibitions, symposia as well as print and<br>
online publications. For more information contact Lotte Betting (coordinator lectorate Design).</p>
<p>Courses and ECTS</p>
<p>Semester I:<br>
•   Future Fossils: 6 ECTS</p>
<p>In this course, a select group of students from KABK and Leiden University will explore the relationship between geological time and design. Using methods drawn from archaeology, anthropology, speculative and critical design, they will conduct research, develop an argument, and speculate through design and/or writing and/or image- making on what will be the fossils of the future.</p>

<p>2.6.6 Combined education</p>
<p>Content &amp; Structure</p>
<p>At the KABK, it is possible to combine art courses with secondary education. This is usually arranged on a case-by-case basis, given that the schedules do not always correspond to each other. In theory, it should be possible to follow at least a part of the same curriculum followed by students of the School for Young Talent. An admissions procedure is required for participation in this preparatory track. Where possible, the applicant’s own school will be consulted, in order to determine the extent to which participation in the preparatory track can be fit into the regular school curriculum. A fee is required for this form of participation, based on the number of classes/half-day periods taken. After completing HAVO, a student may apply for admission to the KABK. A separate admissions procedure is required for these programmes, in combination with the final examination for the visual work.</p>
